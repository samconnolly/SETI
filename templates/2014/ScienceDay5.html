These extraterrestrials have gone through extreme lengths to contact us and to give us an idea of what they are capable of. First they sent us pi then the fibonacci sequence, then telling us that they have an element we do not know of , then their protein structure and then this. Obviously they have the same technological knowledge as we do but we haven't made any effort to contact them back. So we have decided to send them an on off signal as well. A =1 B=11 C=111 and so on. A space between words would be 00000 and between letters would be 0.
<br><br>
So.......

Every day, the aliens have chosen either 142 MHz or 1420 MHz. 1420 MHz is the frequency which is generally observed from hydrogen. It has also been proposed as a good frequency for trying to communicate with extra-terrestrial life, as it wonâ€™t be affected by as many outside influences. 142MHz does not have these properties, but could have been used as another indication that they use base 10. However, if we were to say that all of the messages were a coincidence (which, given the specific messages this week, is unlikely), differences in the hydrogen could explain differences in the signal received.
<br><br>
The fact that there is intelligent life so close makes it likely that there is unintelligent life even closer, so our search for life so far has been incredibly ineffective. However, unintelligent life will be unable to contact us back, which raises the question of whether or not we will be able to find it without travelling to other planets.
<br><br>
One piece of evidence that they know a lot more about Earth than they would have picked up from intercepting voyager or the Arecibo message is how the messages have been picked up by large telescopes. If they just aimed the signal at the Earth, it is very unlikely that it would be picked up by a telescope. This proves that the aliens must have some knowledge of where telescopes are located on Earth, which would require extensive knowledge of our planet.

From a biological point of  view despite not knowing the complications
of actually how the aliens bodies work in relation to ours because of
the picture and yesterdays genome structure we can look further into
this field.<br><br>

Following on from this, from the symmetrical nature of the aliens face
as seen in the diagram which is common with most species we can tell
that they would be very good at attracting a mate. we can also look at
how similar the hands are and say that they may have this as an
adaptation like us in order to use certain tools that they have
crafted throughout generations.<br><br>

Another point which one can make is that speaking to a lead
psychologist we can nearly presume that we will have the same
behaviour and in turn will act the same in situations where they need
to use skills like their fight or flight reflex.<br><br>

From the similarity in genome structures we would also be able to
suggest that they are omnivores with long legs for running as an early
adaptation to catch prey and the hands as mentioned previously to
catch their prey or use their long arms in order to reach fruit.<br><br>

A penultimate point which one must make is that from thinks like the
size of the head, their posture and body position that it is likely
from research from many universities about humans to say that they
will have nearly exactly the same intelligence however this will vary
from alien to alien!<br><br>

My final point is that we would be able to make the assumption that
the Jodrell Observatory and LOFAR experiment have found a planet which
has a broad knowledge in many are for example computer science because
they have managed to send a message right across the stars! They have
also been able to use different binary based ciphers in order to send
their message only to be decoded by a race of high enough intelligence
to match theirs!<br><br>

From previously gathered data, we know about the system thsi is being broadcast from, we know taht they have a similar knowledge to us, but that may have been 153years ago. We also now know  taht it is unlieklt that they are actually from teh system the sugnal appears to originate from. 
<br><br>
Why did they send off a signal of themselves? what does it mean. many people have assumed that this is a welcoming gesture, thsi would eb presuming too much. they are from a different planet they are not humans. tehy could be signaklling an attack, they could be dangerous. why would we assume that they are friendly. i postulate taht it is becuase we humans are social animals, we feel the need to be togerther, stemming fomr teh past where a pack was needed to survive. i think we are presuming too much about the aliens. they have not necessarily has the same background. for instance, among several animals, the facial gesture depicted would be akin to bearing fangs, bearing weapons. it only really seems like taht to us. it is likely taht tehy have a different evolutionary history as their ears are much larger, more akin to a bat's, whcih would suggest a different hunting style in the past. we cannot really assume anything of thsi nature: they may ahve shown to be intellegent, but that does nto mean they are nice.

Aphelion(2):<br><br>
The code transmitted today was a picture of the alien, showing they actually have very similar features to us as they walk, have four limbs, eyes, a head etc. This is surprising as they live in very different conditions, so must have some features which aren't visible from the drawing to protect them from the intense heat. Is also similar to the Arecibo message we sent in the 1980s, but there's is more complex, showing they have better technology than we had in the 1980s. This means that in about another 130 years they may receive the message we sent. This is exciting, however they may then look at us as an inferior race as we had limited technology in the 80s and so only sent a short message.

Lunartics(3):<br><br>
In psychology symmetry is an important factor when animals seek mates. The more symmetrical a face is, for example, the more "attractive" it is deemed to be. Looking at the alien, which has an approximate line of symmetry through their centre vertically, it appears that a similar psychology works among these aliens.
<br><br>
Following from this it is likely that, if their psychology is similar to ours, their behaviour will also mirror ours as they will be motivated and repulsed by similar things to us. This will give us a much deeper understanding of them as people and as a society. In this way we will be able to find many similarities between our two races so interstellar relations between the two races can be built. Through this as scientists we can also study more about their behaviour.
<br><br>
Being humanoid in form, and having similar earth like protein and amino acid structures as on Earth, their biology may be very similar to our own. The fact that they may be more advanced than us could provide advancements in the field of medicine for us. Perhaps they have biology that may be able to halt cancerous growth or cure HIV? 
<br><br>
Their supposed superiority in knowledge may not be confined to medicine and biology - their sending of messages in the mathematical field as well as in chemistry may be their way of telling us that they can advance us in our own understanding of sciences.
<br><br>
The messages in binary may also indicate an advanced understanding in computer science. Perhaps that is another thing they could teach us, especially if they have managed to develop advanced methods to communicate with us, to reduce the time lag. They may have developed a new programming language which is much more simple or much more user friendly than our current systems on earth.

Lunartics(2):<br><br>
Since in the picture we can clearly see the creature appears to be wearing some sort of robe, it suggests they may have similar culture to us in terms of clothing and fashion. They mirror us in the sense that they are probably the most technologically advanced beings on their home planet as we are on ours. The humanoid form therefore appears to be the most advanced in terms of evolution as if they are the most advanced race on their planet as we are on ours, this is strong evidence. 
<br>
The three digits on each hand suggests that this creature uses base 6 in mathematics but may have somehow received the arecibo message, hence transmitted to us in base 10. It is also likely that, as they were transmitting information out into space, they too are looking for signs of life other than themselves so an intergalactic base 10 standard is unlikely.
<br><br>
The frequent repetition of the signal coming from the hydrogen line area of the spectrum at 1420MHz seems to be of some significance - perhaps they are trying to communicate to us something about their planet (e.g. it's atmosphere) or perhaps it is linking back to the DNA transmission they sent yesterday - perhaps the bases are hydrogenous and not the nitrogenous ones that we have?

Infinity(2):<br><br>
The smile and wave that is portrayed in the image recieved is also something worth noting. Amidst over a thousand different languages spoken across Earth, a smile and wave can be recognised and understood by everyone. These friendly gestures can be shared between any two people- no matter how different their languages, cultures and mannerisms are. Smiling and waving are probably the most basic 'words' in universal sign language. A baby generally learns how to execute these two actions fairly early in his/her development and they are a way in which mother and child can effectively communicate.
<br><br>
The idea that extra terrestrial beings are familiar with the same customs and hand gestures/ facial expressions as we are is, in itself, a breakthrough. This image probably also poses many questions on the infamous nature vs nurture argument. Are waving and smiling things that we learn as a result of upbringing? Or is every intelligent being born with an understanding of basic facial expressios and hand gestures?

Infinity(1):<br><br>
The fact that our alien appears to have 2 eyes, 2 ears, 2 hands, 2 arms, 2 legs and 2 feet is a fascinating prospect for scientists and citizens alike! This unexpected and amazing similarity to humans gives the impression that these aliens are in fact not so 'alien' and the presence of the digit 2 in their anatomies may suggest that they have developed a similar way of life to humans.
<br><br>
Do they also have 2 lungs and 2 kidneys? Is their internal structure also similar to ours or is it different? And if it is different, how is it different? While answering many of the greatest questions of mankind, this unique scientific discovery raises just as many or maybe even more...

The Fractals(1): <br><br>

The maths strikes back:<br><br>

We have so far deduced that the aliens life is not dissimilar to our own in nature. Therefore, liquid water would be necessary on the planet. 
To see whetehr this is possible in this system, i shall make a rough calculation fo the 'Goldilocks' zone'. The estimated one for our solar 
system is debated, but for now, I shall use 0.9 and 1.6 AU, roughly based of Kopparapu and associated researchers' 2013 work. The rough way 
for calculating the extent for extrasolar bodies is to take the square root of their luminosity over the Sun's and multiply that by the limits. 
This will be a bit rough. However, to work out the luminosity of a star, one needs to use a variation on teh Stefan-Boltzmann equation for black 
bodies. This comes out as L=4*pi*r^2*sigma*t^4, where sigman erpresents their constant. For the star HD 185269, this works out as<br><br>

L=4*pi*sigma*1712000000000*1279000000000000 (4sf)<br><br>

this is 1560000000000000000000W (4sf) or 1.560*10^21<br><br>

This over the Sun's luminosity is 1.560*10^21/3.846*10^26=1/246500 (4sf)<br><br>

Squared this is 1/60760000000. So the bounds would be 1/67510000000 of an AU and 1/37980000000 of an AU (4sf)
This seems highly unlikely,a sit would be very close to the star and even closer than the Hot Jupiter planet observed. 
So it would seem that it is more likely that the aliens live in a different system and are using the HD 185269 system 
as a relay, as it could not sustain, as far as we know, the planet needed for the type of life implied by the DNA codons yesterday, 
almost identical to Earth's, and today's picture. This would imply a more advanced civilisation as well.<br><br> 3 points <br>

<br><hr> Infinity(1): <br><br> One thing that stands out is the fact that they only have 3 fingers on eatch hand and each foot only has 3 toes. 
So many of our theories say that they must have 10 appendages. Well they don't. This could tell us that maybe base 10 is the intergalactic standard. <br> 1 point <br>

The Fractals(2):<br><br>
<div align="left">'Twould appear as though the aliens are humanoid in nature, from the work of Teams RSETI and Nicedynamite,  upon the assumption that 
this isn't all a hoax. 
Therefore it asks a number of questions, and allows a myriad of inferences. 
<br><br>
Firstly: it would appear that the aliens did indeed have a similar creation, as they have recognisable 
eyes, and, as previously stated by me, they have appendages and features based around powers of two. This would imply that they form and are formed in a similar way to life on our planet:
 an expansion upon the theme of mitosis: ie cells splitting in half. However, it is unnerving that the ears and eyes exist in a recognisable way, which would give credence to some beliefs 
regarding religion and evolution: evolution is a finding ways to a sort of ideal being, discovering something which is already there. As eyes are currently believed to be originally some
 form of liver-like cells, which, through a mutation, gained photosensitive chemicals. Animals which had these could survive being preyed on with greater ease and so on. They appear 
mammalian in nature. This is unnerving. 
<br><br>
Secondly: it would appear that Plato was right in is philosophy that there is an abstract 'idea' of everything. The alien portrayed 
appears to be similar in nature as said, so it would appear that there is one pinnacle of what life can evolve into, that there is an idea somewhere of what life should be, and reality 
tries to follow the pattern. this lends itself quite interestingly to philosophical debates. I am sure that someone would claim this as proof that God exists, that all sentient life 
follows his image.
<br><br>
Thirdly: they appear to have a mouth and nostrils, which, on Earth are needed to intake oxygen and fuel and other nutrients required for life. This would 
suggest that their life is similar to ours, i.e. they need to take in nutrients to survive thus. This would give further credence to my past assertion of a terrestrial home planet. 
However, it would beg the question of how. We are symbiotic with mitochondria, which we believe used to be bacteria, and every mammal and most animals needs them to survive, and 
those which don't are usually symbiotic with algae or plant life. Do the aliens have their version of mitochondria? Does their life function like ours, with the necessity for
 glucose, water, oxygen and myriad ions and metals needed for certain functions?
<br><br>
The last part of this I have put aside for debate: I haven't done much of this.
<br><br>


Addressing Team Mitchell: 
<br><br>

 - The lack of hair shown has no real meaning, in my eyes: it is essentially a 100x100 pixel image, hair cannot be drawn in this form, so it 
may not show anything. Neither does a lack of hair on the head; people have haircuts here, why not there?
<br>
 - Although i find the the toed feet and digit-ed hands interesting, 
as it is an unusual number, and they look rather unwieldy, but common on Earth, so it may suggest a different past to their species, maybe herbivorous, or a hunter on plains? 
However, i do not think that this implies lower gravity, or a lack of necessity for stability: we do not know the scale of the picture, so they may be smaller than us or bigger 
than us, but as i said, they look quite large, so i think that they would be sufficient. 
<br><br>
Addressing Team Nicedynamite:
<br><br>
 - Their thin arms do not necessarily 
imply physical inability: the way the muscles are structured in humans makes lifting require much more force, due to the small moment. the muscles are much better adapted 
for throwing, say spears.
<br>
 - This should go for all comments: this is probably an example of the species, not a blueprint for all: just because I cannot sprint for 100 
metres in under 12 seconds ( im much slower) doesnt mean someone else can.

Well everyone can worry about hidden meanings 
and looking for links to human civilisation and not looking at any of the mathematical reasoning and their links to physics and astronomy<br>  
Let me point out the correlation 
of all of  all the data we have<br><br>

First we got pi<br>
then the golden ratio<br>
then an oscillation pattern.<br> 
As the  pattern that is related to DNA<br><br>

Firstly i 
would like to first start of with the golden ration( a graph built around the fibbionatie sequence) this is a important as it explains the how a wave gets spread out 
overtime (using Huygens principle) secondly DNA is in a shape prescribed by the golden ratio. 
<br><br>
Secondly the graph of the values of Wednesday was that of increasing 
oscillations at a rate of change of 1 or 5<br>
This along with a inceasing pattern like the golden ratio, on get a spreading wave and the equation for the golden ratio 
being \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}<br>
  there is a 1 and a 5 and if you work Wednesdays cipher more on get a proportion of 2.<br>
Now pi simply tells one the cycle of the 
wave (along with Wednesdays Cipher) that being 360.<br>
Therefore the distance from that the planet is 185.41 units away. <br>
Now today they gave us their shape and 
a pattern of binnerys that prove that distance

If we assume that Darwin's theory of evolution is correct, then it is 
very likely that what the aliens have evolved to look like can help reveal what the environment they evolved to function within looks like.
The aliens, from the diagram, 
appear to have evolved in a much warmer climate than humans have. A nose is normally a way in which moisture is lost from our bodies, which can provide difficulties in 
hotter climates. Therefore, since the alien has no nose, this suggests that it has evolved in a warmer climate.
The large ears, much like an elephant, are suggestive 
of a necessity to increase surface area, and therefore lose as much heat as possible.
Furthermore, the lack of hair suggests that an insulatory layer of stationary, 
trapped air is not necessary for the aliens, because their planet is warm enough for hair not to be necessary (see image below).
Their similarities to humans must also 
be noted. They are symmetrical bipeds, and use gestures for communication. Being bipeds suggests that they do not need to run from anything, meaning that they may be 
the dominant species on their planet. Gestures and clothing shows that they have developed a culture and society beyond simple survival, and may have developed feelings 
of modesty, prudishness, and politeness. It is unclear whether the alien depicted is male or female, and since only one alien is depicted, the aliens may actually be 
asexual. 
Although they only have three fingers, this has not appeared to affect their dexterity and ability to survive and thrive.

The aliens have eyes on the front of their head, which means they that most likely 
are or were predators, like us. Their eyes are large, so it could be dark where they live. They have six fingers, including two opposable thumbs. These thumbs would make 
it much easier for them to carry out human-like activities. Also, they are likely to work in base 6, which means that it is likely that they are only sending us messages 
in base 10 because they have been watching us. They are also waving, which shows that they already know about our customs, which further shows this. As well as this, the 
waving indicates that they are trying to be friendly. They have large ears, which could mean that they use sound as their main form of communication, or echo-location. 
They have very thin arms, which indicates that they donâ€™t do much physical work, so are probably very technologically advanced.
<br><br>
Following on from the observations 
of Aphelion and the Lunartics, we have been looking at the Arecibo message. It was only released 40 years ago, so would not have time to travel 150 light years. However, 
if the aliens have some method of faster-than-light travel, which we have not yet produced, they could have intercepted the signal and the information in it. The signal 
contained information about the location of the solar system, which would have allowed them to send the signal directly to us. We sent the signal in the same format that 
they have been sending it to us, which is probably why they chose this format.
<br><br>
The aliensâ€™ use of this signal tells us a lot about how much they know about Earth. 
They must have knowledge of our computer systems to provide this in a format that would allow us to decipher it, as they would need to know how we would be able to remove 
a string of zeroes and change the font size. This could tell us that they have already been able to access the Earthâ€™s computer systems, proving that their intelligence is 
far beyond ours. It could also indicate that their computer systems are very similar to ours.
<br><br>
Their ability to transmit the signal without distortion is also very 
impressive. Over a distance of 153 light years, there should have been some distortion or loss, but we still received a very precise signal. Constructing todayâ€™s signal must 
have also been a difficult, yet they managed to send it in a format which we could decode in only an hour.

This image is very 
similar to the Arecibo message, sent from Puerto Rico in 1974. The image depicted multiple sections, including mathematics, the human body, chemistry, and our location in 
relation to the sun. 
But what does the image that Nice Dynamite cracked tell us? Firstly, it tells us that they are friendly, assuming that a waving gesture and smile still 
represents a positive greeting in their culture. After all, if they are opening their hand to us, it shows that they have no weapons. Furthermore, they appear to be wearing 
clothing, a form of shirt. Does this mean that they share similar cultural beliefs to us? Also, the feet only appears to have 3 digits, suggesting that perhaps balance is 
not needed as much on their planet: perhaps a lower gravity environment? Also, the alien appears not to have any hair, suggesting the environment is not cold.

The Arecibo message was sent towards the 
Hercules constellation which is situated right next to the Cygnus constellation, very close to where the transmissions this week have been detected. In the arecibo 
message, numbers 1 through to 10 were transmitted so if this was received by the aliens, they would know that we work in the decimal system. As well as this the DNA helix 
and the enzymes were also transmitted. It is lik
ely, looking at this information that the aliens have received the Arecibo message and have been responding accordingly. The atomic numbers for certain elements were also 
present in the Arecibo message. What we have been transmitted seems to be a reply to that directly. 
<br>
It was sent 40 years ago in 1974 by Frank Drake , suggesting that 
the aliens are in fact closer to us than we might think, only around 20 light years away perhaps. This would also mean that they have relayed these messages in such a way 
that they appear to be coming from the cygnus constellation to us.

Death Star(1):<br><br>

We've been thinking about sending a spaceship out there some 
more.<br><br>

At 1 g acceleration naively it takes 3x10^7s = 1 year or so to accelerate to the speed of light.. we realize that
would be hard to achieve over such a long 
period.<br><br>

When you're travelling close to the speed of light Relativity says that time passes slower by a "gamma" factor
that (we think) 
is <br><br>

gamma = SquareRoot[ 1/( 1- v^2/c^2)]<br><br>

here v is your speed and c the speed of light. So to contract say 200 years of travel to 20 years 
needs gamma=10.
That's v of about 99.7% of the speed of light. It doesn't seem totally impossible that a person could make it in their lifetime...<br>
<br>

Putting aside the reliability of the spaceship we wonder if anyone would want to do this? Probably - at age 40
you leave home and at age 60 arrive on
 the alien world - sounds fun... you'd get to watch 200 odd years of Earth history on
the TV too, scientific breakthroughs etc... if the spaceship was big 
enough to hold a city of people then you wouldn't
even be isolated. Let's build an arc!<br><br> 2 points <br> <hr>

RSETI(2): <br><br>
The aliens have sent us 
a picture of themselves. As has been the trend 
it's not as exciting as we would have expected. The alien looks like an 
alien should look according to popular 
culture. Given that there is 
space is massive, too massive to comprehend, nature is being a bit lazy. 
She could have at least made them look a bit different! 
Perhaps a 
tentacle or three?!<br><br>

It is possible however that all intelligent life looks similar because 
that's the only way intelligent life can look. 
The aliens clearly have 
hands which are important to make tools. Maybe this in the key to being 
intelligent and being able to send the messages. We only 
see aliens that 
look like us because only aliens that look like us have the technology 
to send transmissions like this. There may be other life out there 
which 
looks strange to us but don't have the ability to contact us. Dolphins 
for example are considered intelligent but they cannot affect their 
environment.<br>
<br>

The other option is that it looks like an alien should look to us 
because one of us sent it. So far the aliens have yet to seem 
particularly alien. 
Everything has been understandable and sort of what 
we would expect. It is possible that this is all a practical joke.

<p> SETI DATA RELEASE <p>

KAT-7, SA: The KAT-7 telescope has picked up a third alien transmission frequency at the 1.42GHz. We expected a glitch at 21.52 UTC
(MJD 2456856.41113). We observed a glitch followed by an
end to the whole signal. HartRAO confirm the sessation of the signal at 1420 MHz and LOFAR confirm the sessation
of the signal at 142MHz at the same time after the same glitch pattern.
The final glitch pattern was: <p>
