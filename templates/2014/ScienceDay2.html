RSETI(3): <br> 
It is interesting to note that whoever sent these messages did so in a digital way, ie. high signals and then low signals. It is therefore somewhat peculiar, at least to us, that they did not encode their numbers in binary. They opted for a much simpler - or perhaps more obvious - encoding method.
<br>
This could suggest that they have no knowledge of binary and, going further, they can not have computers. However, even if this were true then it may not be the case at this moment in time. If it is true that the signal is from HD 185269 then it was sent around 153 years ago. In that time who knows how far they could have advanced? They could have surpassed our knowledge in that time. Or perhaps they have never had the need for traditional binary computers and discovered quantum computers or some other technology first? 
<br>
However I think a much more logical suggestion is that the people who sent this message were not assuming anything about the intelligence of the receiver of the message. Trans-galaxy communication is difficult enough (due to the rather long time delay) without confusing the recipient of your message.

The Fractals(3): <br> 
There have been many speculations about how technologically advanced the aliens are. One way to 
consider this is the amount of power would be needed to send this signal.<br><br>

Like most important forces and ideas in the Universe, the amount of power needed to send an 
electromagnetic emission increases proportionally to the square of the distance.<br><br>

Therefore, if we can pick up signals from Voyager, then the amount of power needed to send 
those is proportional to the amount the aliens need.<br><br>

The approximate distance of Voyager 1 is 15000000000000 meters from Earth.<br><br>

HD 165269 is 153 light years away, which is equivalent to 1447460846748360000m<br><br>

Therefore the rough ratio of Voyager 1 to Aliens is 1:96500. If we then square this, this becomes 1:9312250000.<br><br>

Interestingly, the Voyager craft use 23 Watt radios to transmit, however, 23*9312250000=214181750000W, or 214181750KW.<br><br>

On average, a nuclear power plant generates ~11,800,000,000 kilowatt-hours per year. On the first signal, 
containing pi, the signal broadcast was picked up for thirteen days. Assuming full days, that would amount 
to 24*13*214181750=66,824,706,000KWh. This is the amount of energy generated by a conventional nuclear power 
station over a period of 5 years and about 8 months. This would mean to broadcast this signal towards other 
planets would be a serious drain on their resources, especially as this would be devoted to (hopefully) a 
purely scientific and research based means. Also, as we think this is coming from 153 years in the past, 
they must have a more advanced method of power generation than us, and by now, if they still survive, 
they are probably much more advanced than we are.<br><br>

NB: The methods of calculation do not take into account differing frequencies or signal strength, and 
are rather rough: these are meant to give an understandable idea of the situation. <br> 3 points <br> <hr>

Tomshanoenyu(3): <br>

Evidence suggests that pulsars are extra-terrestrial 
radio beacons for getting the attention of other 
intelligent life. This goes with the problem that 
scientists aren’t quite sure why stars become pulsars. 
This would explain why the glitch in the signal doesn’t 
have interference from the repeating on off signal; the 
pulsar is being used to transmit the signal. They may be 
transmitting it in multiple directions using a vast 
network of pulsars to find any intelligent life that they 
can. This could explain the frequency change as they may 
be trying multiple frequencies to find one that other 
life is listening into or it may simply require so much 
energy that they can’t keep the signal going on the same 
frequency for very long.<br> <br>

The signal means that the life form must have been 
advanced at the time of sending the signal. This could 
lead to many debates about what state the extra-
terrestrials are in now. There could have been some kind 
of apocalypse upon their planet which would leave us 
almost where we started. The impacts of this would leave 
us all, no doubt, feeling empty as there would be no more 
signals or response to our signals. However if this were 
to happen what would scientists do? Already scientists 
are dreaming of what we could learn from them. If they 
had died would their technology have died with them or 
would we be able to salvage it from the ruins of their 
civilisation? <br> 2 points <br> <hr> 
 



Flowers(2):<br>In both of the signals the pulses lasted 4.1 light seconds. 
This could mean the aliens are trying to tell us where they are. By calculating 
9.5x10^15 x 4.1 we could work out how far away they are, using 9.5x10^15m being a 
light second. Using this, the aliens would be 3.895x10^16m away. We would then be 
able to search for the aliens by using this as the radius of a circle as they would 
be somewhere on the circumference of the circle.<br><br>

This distance means the aliens could be near or orbiting Proxima Centauri, which is 
about 3.99x10^16m from the Sun. Therefore, we have a possible location of the aliens, 
although we can't at the moment travel that far. <br> 1 point <br> <hr>




Team Parallax(1):<br>
By using the second line of code and taking out the double 0 we can add up the 1's and use the 
0's to make 10's, for example, 10111 gives 13. When this process is used with the rest of the 
code it gives the Fibonacci series. Because the life forms are sending the Fibonacci series this 
could lead us to believe that they may have some of the same body parts as us, for example the 
Fibonacci spiral is similar shape to the shape of our ears. The numbers can be used as well, 
1 head and 2 ears, we have 2 arms each with 3 sections (upper arm, lower arm and hand). If 
these are not just coincidence then we could use the numbers to imagine what the life form could look like. <br> 1 point <br> <hr>






Aphelion(3):
<br>  
Using the coordinates Right Ascension 19 hours 37 min 11.7 sec and Declination +28 degrees 29 arcmin 59 arsec set out by the second signal, we have found out that the transmission is from the area of the star HD 185269 which is located 153 million light years away in Cygnus. It is larger than the Sun and is four times brighter. The star is almost in the red giant stage, meaning it is cooling down, possibly leading to major evolution in the aliens, and making them more intelligent, leading to advances in technology. There is only one recorded planet which orbits this star which is called HD 185269 b. It was discovered in 2006 by Johnson and Moutou. This planet is extrasolar meaning it is outside of the solar system and is also described as 'hot Jupiter' which means it is a similar size to Jupiter and is a gas giant, but also has very high surface temperatures due to its close proximity to the star. The planet must also have started in a larger orbit, but moved forwards as it wouldn't be possible for it to have formed as such a mass so close to the star. As the planet is close to the star the atmosphere is ripped off, but the planet can be just far enough out to keep some of the atmosphere which usually consists of hydrogen and helium. The orbit is also more eccentric than useful for hot Jupiters and therefore has probably reached a stage where it about rotates three times for every two orbits causing strange weather patterns and large seasonal changes, making it more hostile. Using simulations scientists have proven that these planets can be in the habitable or 'Goldilocks zone'. This shows that it is possible the aliens do live in similar conditions to us, including having water on the planet. However, it would be far hotter than on Earth (averaging 1300K), so the extraterrestrials must look very different from us to survive in the conditions. On the other hand, the planet could be hostile and have almost no atmosphere, not being considered as habitable at all, showing that life can exist in previously thought impossible conditions. This planet now needs further investigation to check that the signals are actually from this planet rather than another planet or spaceship nearby.

The Fractals(2):
<br>
From the results of the right ascension and declination from LOFAR, the previous assertion of the solar body being HD185269 is most likely correct. It has been asserted that the known planetary body orbiting the star is a 'Hot Jupiter' planet. What would be of import is whether this planet could sustain life, at least conventionally. First of all, the estimated surface temperature of the planet is 1295 Kelvin, or 1008°C. This is relatively very high, as in our solar system, Venus, the hottest, is on average 462°C on the surface. At this temperature, atoms and molecules would become very excited, which would lead to problems for life. For instance, in our body, cells will denature at 
~60°C, as their component atoms and molecules gain enough energy to break or destabilise some of their bonds. If we were to put life on the planet in question, it would not be able to exist in its known form, as cells could not hold together. In addition, the gravitational attraction must be considered, as too high or too low gravity could effect life. As the force of attraction is given as g=(GMm)/r^2. Where r is the distance and G the gravitational constant. As F=ma,
    <br>                                                                                                                                                                                                          
The acceleration due to gravity, on Earth ~9.81ms^-2, would be given as: 
<br>
a=GM/r^2
<br>
Where M is the mass of the planet, in this instance.
<br>
Therefore the acceleration towards the planet's centre of mass would be roughly 119061501000000000  r^2                                                                                                                                                           
<br>
We do not exactly know the radius, but, by observation, it is circa 42351000m
<br>
Therefore the acceleration due to gravity, presuming a spherical planet, is ~66ms^-2, roughly 6.7 times as great. Thus the gravitational field strength would be ~66N/kg. This would make surviving extremely difficult, as, for us, our bones would be crushed. 
<br>
Finally, according to the composition of Jupiter, it would be 99% hydrogen and helium, making carbon-based life impossible. Therefore, it is likely that a) there is no life, as a myriad of elements are required for life; b) the enormity of this planet is stopping us from perceiving another, more inhabitable planet; c) the aliens do not truly live upon said planet, but use the area as a relay station or somesuch.

The Pi-gressives(3):<br>
The Fibonacci curiously stopped at 55, maybe due to 10 numbers being their message limit at the time of transmission. 55 is again an interesting integer as it is a semiprime (due to 55 = 5 x 11). However, most unexpectedly, 55 is the largest Fibonacci number to also be a triangular number (it is the sum of 1 to 10) i.e. the extraterrestrials are aware of even more fundamental sequences, and possibly the algebra behind them.
<br>
In addition to this, 55 is the atomic number of Caesium - an increasingly important element in the petroleum industry. However, Caesium is relevant to how we keep a measurement of time, implying that - at the time of transmission - the aliens may have had a similar atomic clock system to ours today. On top of this, Caesium is used in electronics and medicine, which scratches at some of the things they may have had when the message was sent.

Globular(3):<br>
By adding all of the terms of the Fibonacci sequence given to us we get 143. This is very close to the frequency of the transmission, which was 142 Hz. Also, if you divide 16 (the sum of the digits of Pi given to us, as was done yesterday) by 143, then the answer is 1/9, or 0.1 recurring. Recurring decimals go on to infinity, perhaps suggesting the universe is infinite. This could just be a coincidence, however it is interesting how the numbers have computed.

KRS(2):<br>
If we look back at the phi related code and look at the golden spiral represented in the current code we can infer that the galaxy is a spiral that is moving.
<br>
Also we have researched different mathematic codes and have predicted from our research that the next code will be about the equation eI?=-1. Tomorrow's code could translate to be 2.71828183 because Pi and Phi are both transcendental numbers and so is e. e is also the base of the natural algorithm and a natural exponential function. This would confirm our theory that there is a spiral galaxy as phi creates spirals and the e formula creates spirals, which can be calculated using polar coordinates. These co-ordinates point next to Albireo, at +27 degrees. This may indicate that this is where they are based.

Infinity(2):<br>
The repeated on off signal was sent at a frequency of 142 MHz which places the electromagnetic waves in the radio spectrum. This is noticeably lower than the previous message which was sent at a frequency of 1420 MHz (microwave frequency). It is possible that the aliens seek to demonstrate their knowledge of the electromagnetic spectrum and ability to use different parts of it in communication. However this change in frequency could be interpreted differently. As Team Mitchell identified, 142 is 10% of 1420 and this additional reference to the number 10 once again gives hints of the aliens' knowledge of the mechanisms of Earth and/or the significance of the number on their own planet.<br>

The number 142 itself also holds some significance in astrophysics- HD I42 is a 6th magnitude star in the Phoenix constellation and 142 Polana is a dark main belt asteroid. Could the aliens have possibly included a meeting place in their message? Maybe they have a space station set up at one of these locations and view it at a convenient place for humans to safely reach...

Developing the idea about the Fibonacci sequence being in plants and flowers, maybe that could indicate likelihood of carbon dioxide gas oxygen or any other gases which fuel extraterrestrial life forms on their planet which in turn could then denote the composition of gases on their planet. However it could also be that they use a completely different gas such as sulphur which hinted at yesterday due to the significance of the number 16. The sequence may also depict how the life forms are made up and what they look like as the human body itself is made up using the Fibonacci sequence with frequent numeral repetitions of 1,2,3 and 5 in our make up. Perhaps this is what they are trying to announce to us? That they are simply only human beings in themselves and come in peace?

This picture is taken from an exoplanet website. It shows a simulation of the orbit of the gas giant - go to the web site to see the movie version. But we mustn't forget that exoplanets can only be detected if they (a) transit their star, or (b) are big enough to introduce measurable motion in their home star. A smaller planet like the Earth could easily not satisfy either of those conditions and therefore remain undetected so far.

Interesting Facts about the source HD 185269:

It is 153 Light Years away (1.44746085e18 metres) or 1.4 exameters.
Even so, it is so bright (4 times brighter than our sun) it can be seen between 9pm and 3am (source: Harvard University) with binoculars.
It has a known planet in its orbit, taking 6.8 days to orbit the sun, and is classed as a 'hot jupiter' like planet.
HD 185269 is a glass G star, which means it can be unstable (GOIV). 
<br><br>
Therefore, are the communications a final cry for help? Is the only other life form in the known universe in danger?

The Pi-gressives(2):<br>

The aliens have so far sent us Pi and the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is linked to Phi (golden ratio), and Pi, as both are irrational and transcendental (i.e. they aren't solutions to integer polynomials). What one must consider is how we would try to communicate to aliens - what would we send? It is certain that at least one mathematical constant would be sent out, as we would like to "test" the intelligence of the recipient species before exerting the effort to actually make contact with them.<br>

Besides that, we now have another RA and DEC for the star, which should allow us to put an upper bound on its orbital period, taking into account some assumptions. First, we assume that our previous star guess was correct (the values for the 2 distances mentioned yesterday will be shown), i.e. HD185269 at about 153ly away. Secondly, we shall assume that relativistic effects don't apply (the Earth is moving relative to the signal star, which means that in actuality we are "cutting" through space-time differently to the aliens). Thirdly, we shall assume again that since we are dealing with sufficiently large distances, r(theta) will be close enough to the actual chord length of a circle of that size. Lastly, assume that Earth and the alien planet orbit in the same plane (this is important, as it will allow us to put an upper bound on the orbital period).<br>

Now, we previously had a RA of 19, 37, which has now increased by 11.7 arcsec which is roughly 1.576 x 10^-7 rad. Including the vertical translation and using pythag, we have a movement of 2.29 x 10^11m, which indicates that the planet quite literally whizzes in orbit (checking this against validated sources online, especially for Kepler 186f). Not only this, but there is a tilt angle of 4.89 degrees, which is very significant considering the distances the signal was sent across. In other words, the signal is very likely to have been pre-meditated, as the mechanical chances of randomly sending out a signal to another planet that is tilted as such is almost nothing, considering that we cannot even find planets that have a tilted orbit to us using precise methods. Also, this indicates a higher form of intelligence.

Nice Dynamite(2):<br>
The planet of the Cygnus constellation in question recieves only a third of the energy that the Earth recieves from the Sun from its star. This could lead us to many different conclusions about the biology of the life forms on Earth.<br>
The food chain could be very efficient and consist of only herbivores and omnivores, as at each stage of the food chain energy energy is lost due to a variety of reasons including heat, movement and growth. Because there is less heat being absorbed by the planet, the organisms must either be warm blooded or a cross between cold and warm blooded, like the dinosaurs, which would mean that they would have to eat a lot just to maintain their body temperature which would require a large of energy. The pyramid of biomass decreases as it goes up, so the complex organisms decrease; therefore, the energy requirement for the complex organism would be higher, so the organisms in question must be close to the beginning of the food chain.<br>
Following this idea, for there to be enough food, the light intensity absorbed by the planet must be quite high to provide the energy for the plants to perform a function like photosynthesis to convert the light energy to energy used to heal and grow.
Another conclusion which may be drawn is the planet should have a liquid state of water, as the star is an M1 type dwarf star, which means it should burn hydrogen for the rest of its life. This would be long enough for the formation of different organisms, which could develop into more complex lifeforms able to send such a signal.

We suggest that time difference between receiving the signals may give us some clue as to the length of the day on the source planet. We received the signal 1 hour and 16 minutes earlier on the second day, so if they had sent the signal at the same time on their day, their day may be only 22 hours and 44 minutes long. There may be a slight time difference if they are moving towards us, but it is unlikely that this made such a large effect.
 <br>
One of our team has expressed his opinions on the significance of the fibonacci sequence. He has raised the fact that the Fibonacci sequence occurs very commonly in nature, in the form of the golden ratio and the golden spiral. This could indicate plant life on their planet. However, the same pattern occurs in spiral galaxies, so this could be the source of their understanding of the significance of this sequence. The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy, which may be why they chose to send this sequence to us - They assume that the structure of our galaxy gives us an understanding of the Fibonacci series. This indicates that they meant for the signal to reach us.
 <br>
Other team members have speculated that the aliens have been sending us mathematical sequences and constants to prove their intelligence to us. The fibonacci sequence was discovered much more recently than pi, so it is possible that their next message will contain a much more recently discovered constant, such as the Planck constant. On the other hand, they have already proven their intelligence, so their next signal may contain more important information - Such as the location of their planet.

I don't think we need to get distracted by the change in coordinates between the two days. The first set given seem to lack the precision of the second set, so maybe it reflects the capabilities of the two different telescopes designs to position points on the sky? I wonder how they do it?
 <br>
I am also curious to know what power is required to send a signal across 153 light years. Surely it must be huge? I read somewhere that modern radio telescopes can just detect Pioneer 10 on the edge of our solar system – can we use that info to work out the power of the signal being sent to us??

Extra-terrestrials were going to be found eventually as shown by the Drake equation which theoretically proves extra-terrestrials must exist due to the estimated amount of planets and the probability of them hosting life: Number  of civilisations in the milky way which we may be able to contact with radio = Average rate of star formation in our galaxy*Fraction of them that have planets*Fraction of them that can potentially support life*fraction that actually do develop life*fraction of life that goes on to become intelligent*fraction that develop the technology to release detectable signs of their existence into space*how long they release signals into space for. This equation does not have exact numbers for the calculation of alien life but with most estimates of the numbers it reveals that life should exist with which we can communicate. We also know that the signals must be alien in origin as the patterns that were sent are highly unlikely to appear in nature and they are a good choice for extra-terrestrials to send as it is not naturally occurring and should be understood by intelligent life.
<br>
The drop in frequency from 1420Mhz to 142Mhz suggests a great power loss which could go with the theory that the signals are being remotely sent through a black hole or quark star or similar astronomical feature as it would almost definitely take loads of power to do such a thing.
<br>
The signals Pi and Phi are related and it makes sense that the extra-terrestrials sent them in the order they did as Pi can be used to create a circle and Phi can be derived from a circle.

The code represents the fibbonacci series.This is another mathematical phenomena. This implies that the aliens are aware of sequences and series. The fibbonacci series occurs natrually in plants and animals on earth, the fact that the aliens have sent it to us implies that they could have a similar world to earth with plants and animals in with similar physiology. The signal was sent at 142Mhz. They may be trying different frequencies because they haven't had a reply yet so are trying all bandwidths. Also they are sending different mathematical constants because they may think we don't understand the previous one they sent. The previous glitch sent was Pi, Pi and the Fibbonacci series are linked in a formula.

It has been stated over and over again that whoever is sending out these signals is more advanced in maths and science then we are. If this is true then maybe this message wasn't sent a few centuries or millennia ago. It might have been months, weeks or even days. We have based all our findings on what we know the laws of physics to be like. In WW2 the Manhattan project showed us that a theory to split an atom could be achieved then whats to say other theories can't also be proven correct? In 1967 Gerald Feinberg coined the term tachyon. For those who don't know a tachyon is a hypothetical faster then light particle. It is possible that this sentient race has found a way to create a tachyon drive. In theory this gives them the ability to travel faster then light. If that is possible who knows how long it might have taken for the message to have reached us. The bigger problem facing mankind is that if they do have the ability to create and harness tachyons then they have the ability to create a warp drive craft. This may not be too different from the Alcubierre drive designed by Miguel Alcubierre. If it is possible to travel faster then light then whats to say these extra terrestrials don't know how. One of the largest problems of warp drives is the energy to power it. Exotic matter is required to fuel the reaction. We do not know how to create let alone harness exotic matter. The closest we have come is to create antimatter in the antiproton decelerator at CERN.If we can create antimatter what can a species with possible millennia of scientific advances do?

The possible planet from which the signal was sent HD 185269 b is a hot-gas planet. This planet is very similar to Jupiter. Jupiter has a gravitational force two and a half times stronger then our own. This would mean if there is any life on that planet it would have had to evolve a much more powerful skeletal system to what we have. As stated by a previous group the temperature is also very different to ours.

A CAR(1):<br>
The numbers appear to follow the Fibonacci sequence. As the Fibonacci sequence appears in earths biology we can assume that they are aware of these numbers because of the biology of their planet. This could mean that they have a similar atmosphere to our own and so similar life forms exist on this planet. Also as the Fibonacci sequence exists in the Bee Ancestry Code it is possible that they reproduce following a similar pattern.
<br>
As the Fibonacci sequence forms a spiral we can assume that the signal is originating from inside the Milky Way due to the fact that the Milky Way is a spiral shaped galaxy.
<br>
The use of this sequence also shows us they have an in depth knowledge of numbers and sequences and how they work. This would suggest that they are of equal or greater intelligence than ourselves. The use of two different frequencies is also highly significant as this shows they have the technology to send signals at several frequencies across the galaxy. We can also assume that the orbit of the planet is not very wide as the signal was observed from the same region of the sky and so it cannot be great otherwise we would not have picked up the signal.

The signal came from star HD185269 - this is a yellow main sequence star, which has a spectral type of G2V. G2V is the same spectral type as our own sun. This star has only one exo planet orbiting it at a distance of 0.077 AU. This exo-planet is likely to be where the signal is coming from. This star is 1.28 times the mass of our sun. This makes the star very similar to our own sun which makes it more likely that there is life on the exo-planet which would subsequently that the signal came from that life. However, the exo-planet is only 0.077 AU away from its star which is much closer than the Earth to our sun, (1 AU), therefore the temperatures on the exo-planet will be much more extreme. So if life did in fact reside on this planet - it would have to be more adapted to the extreme environment - the life could be more evolved than us. This is more evidence to imply that the life form is more advanced than us, the human race.

It may be that the two signals given thus far refer to the Earth and then the shape and motion of our galaxy.
<br>
Could we predict that therefore future signals may refer to complex numbers (as in black holes) or infinity (as in the expanding nature of the universe)?

Turing Machines(2):<br>

Today's code is similar to yesterdays in that it starts and ends with the same sequence of ones and zeros, this must be some sort of standard encryption for the aliens. In the sequence itself each number is separated by 2 zeros, also in the sequence the digits in a double digit number are separated by a single 0. This supports the idea that the aliens have a good understanding of maths and encryption, also that they use base 10 in their mathematics. Looking at the direction of the signal in terms of coordinates we can see that there is a change in the declination by 1 arc second which is equal to 1/60 arc minute or 1/3600 of a degree. Although this is only a minor change, over a large distance a small change can be quiet significant. There is also a change in the right ascension of the signal by 11.7 sec since yesterdays signal. This means that the source of the signal is further away and slightly lower relative to the equator.

The fibonacci sequence can be seen throughout nature, such as the number of petals on in a flower or sections in a fruit or in the way our cells are arranged in our body. The logarithmic fibonacci spiral can also be seen in nature, in such things as shells. This shows us that the extra terrestrial life has discovered this as we did, and could be telling us that they have a world similar to ours based upon this number sequence. This tells us there are many similarities between our world and theirs, and also that they are advanced in the field of mathematics as they can detect the maths within nature. 
In addition to this, the Fibonacci sequence can be link to the constant Pi, noted yesterday, using Euler's formula. Euler's formula and the Fibonacci sequence can then be used to compute Pi. My knowledge of this is very limited, but it is interesting that the extra terrestrial life has sent us a constant and number sequence so profound in nature that is so very important to our understanding of the universe. 
Something I also noticed was that we were given the first 10 numbers of the sequence, and yesterday we were also given the first 10 digits of Pi.

Todays sequence was broadcast at 142MHz, contrary to yesterdays 1420MHz. This is a major difference, because the absolue flux scale below about 400MHz is rather uncertain. The fact that 1420/10 is 142 could be significant, however we are unsure how. Perhaps it is the aliens showing us that they can access a range of radio frequencies, and testing us to see if we can too. They have sent us two important mathematical sequences/numbers, perhaps they have some sort of mathematical language as this would explain their choice to send us numbers as oppose to messages. And as they have chosen to communicate in base-10 again, maybe they use it more commonly than we do, or consider it a universal language? The Fibonacci sequence is important as if you divide the second number by the first it is always close to the golden ratio. the golden ratio is present throughout nature, presenting the possibility the extraterrestrials also have the golden ratio. They also stop after 55, and we have to question why this is. Maybe they have only managed to send a certain length message as both transmissions have been similar lengths so far? Or they think it's long enough to demonstrate what they know? They also chose to leave out the 0s at the start of the sequence, which is an option, but why did they decide to do this?

Today's signal is the Fibonacci sequence. This could link in with the transmitted signal from yesterday as Fibonacci and Pi have historically both been used in architectural design, such as in the pyramids etc. Bearing this in mind, the signal could be designed to give a clue as to the location of the aliens within a 4 dimensional space rather than a single plane.

As you get a fibbonacci sequence. This means that the aliens have a similar mathematical system as humans.

The signal is the Fibonacci sequence, using base 10 with 0s separating the tens and units. Both the signals have been important in maths and could be the aliens testing our intelligence. It also shows they are intelligent as they recognise the mathematical importance of the Fibonacci sequence.<br>
The fibonacci series appears in nature, for example the scales on a pinapple and the bracts of a pinecone follow it. This could mean that the aliens are watching us and know that the fibonacci sequence appears in our environment. It could also mean that the fibonacci sequence appears in their environment as well, suggesting they live in a similar environment to us.

The fibonacci sequence is often seen on Earth in nature. For example the 
number of spirals in sunflower seeds is usually a Fibonacci number. The 
spirals which fit inside the Golden Rectangle (again, related to the 
Fibonacci sequence) can be seen in spiral galaxies.
<br>
It is possible that the people who sent the message have seen this 
pattern in their own world and somehow know that it will appear in other 
worlds. This could even suggest that there is plant life similar to ours 
on their planet!

Lunartics(2):<br>
The LOFAR experiment is the most sensitive radio observatory, detecting within the range of frequencies between approximately 10 - 240 MHz. This could suggest that the extraterrestrial life is sending  a frequency 10 times lower than last time in order to test whether or not we can receive it, and thus judge how advanced our technology is.
<br>
The observation of the Fibonacci sequence further suggests, after yesterday's transmission, that this life form also works in base 10. The twelve 0s at the end of the transmission is similar to that of yesterday's, which could suggest that in 12 day's time, another or the same transmission will be submitted.  This also suggests that the twelve 0s are of significance to the life-form, as they have appeared at the end of both transmissions. (In relation to the twelve 0s the time that the glitch was observed, 1:20 a.m, could also have significance as it contains the number 12. This extends to general significance such as months in a year in our calendar as well as 12 hours in half an Earth day.)

The aliens have now sent two different messages, one including pi and the other the Fibonacci series. This proof of life tells us that Drake's equation (N=R* . fp . ne . fl . fi . fc . L [the probability of other life forms existing in the Milky Way] is more than one since the nearest other galaxy in the Cygnus constellation is millions of light years away, and thus the radio signal is unlikely to have survived and reached us from that far. There is one habitable planet in the Goldilocks zone in the Cygnus constellation, known as Kepler-186f, which is 500 light years away (or 153.3 parsecs as parsecs are the favoured unit of astronomers). The planet comes from a significantly different area to the approximate coordinates given for both the first and second days, however these were approximate and also could have been misread or distorted by factors such as the expanding universe, (ie, when the signal was sent it was from the direction of the coordinates given, however the galaxy has expanded and changed since then and the exact position is now useless). Having said this, 150 parsecs away is relatively close and therefore the distortion is unlikely to be that great, or at least not significantly greater than the difference between the two days. The fact that there is a habitable planet relatively close to the message source is still interesting and it could be the alien's home planet, from where they have expanded or sent a space shuttle? Currently we have no idea of the conditions on Kepler-186f but the James Webb telescope hopes to provide some insight into the composition of the planet and its atmosphere, unless of course we learn something from the future cipher messages. The current messages seem to provide little information of a chemical nature, unless Infinity were correct in their reference to sulphur, however this idea seems too caught up in the notion that the signal is originating from the seemingly uninhabitable planet closely orbiting HD 185269. Perhaps the first signal sent was nothing more than pi, and scientists are looking at it for some hidden message when it was simply an attempt to find other intelligent life forms.

Pi and the Fibonacci sequence. we know Fibonacci sequence can be used to compute pi. But there is another mathematical value that ties in with all of these. The golden ratio. 1.618. This ratio is present in the natural spirals that occur with Fibonacci sequences. This value has also been called one of the two precious jewels of math by Johannes Kepler. This value is called the divine proportion.

The beginning and ending line is “1111111111000000000011111111110000000000...” which seems to be the start and end of the transmission signal with the section in the middle being the main signal.
The following numbers are encoded in the message:
1,2,1,2,2,2,3,2,5,2,8,2,1,1,3,2,2,1,1,2,3,1,4,2,5,1,5,2,10
The numbers on:
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5
These numbers are significant in our mathematics, as they are closely linked to golden ratio, which is 2/1, 3/2, 5/3, 8/5, as we see in the sequence of on signals. Fibonnacci discovered this sequence in the 12th century, and the significance of the golden ratio dictates the ratio of nature, in everything from shells to the ratio of the human anatomy. The aliens could be trying to understand more about life on earth; they could have a lot of knowledge on what the human race is like; or maybe they sent this before we discovered it as a helping hand to human progress? The aliens could potentially know a lot about human development.

The aliens have sent us a pattern consisting of a number which is the sum of two previous numbers which is   known as the fibonacci series. This suggests that the aliens might also know the golden ratio. Another theory is that the aliens also may have known of earth's existence before 700 AD since that is when the series had risen assuming that they were watching earth's progress

The sequence is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 45 which is the Fibonacci sequence of numbers. Each number is calculated by adding the two previous numbers in the sequence. This is a very interesting sequence of numbers which can be seen a lot in nature, for example the number of petals on many flowers happens to be a number in the Fibonacci sequence. It is also a representation of the fastest possible growth of a rabbit population. As you go further and further in the sequence, dividing a number by the previous number in the sequence converges on the value of Phi, which is approximately 1.618. This is known as the golden ratio and often occurs in nature, even in the human body.
If the aliens are sending this, then it must be of some importance to them, so it is possible that they have observed such things where they are from. This would show similarities in our two worlds that have developed, even though we are so far apart.

Team Mitchell(3):

Analysis of the signal shows that it has been projected at a frequency of 142MHz, which is only 10% of the first signal's frequency. Why? 10 may be an important value to the aliens, or it may simply be that the aliens do not know what frequency the rest of the universe uses, so they sent out a volley of multiple frequencies, just to make sure.
The golden ratio, funnily enough, can be derived from a circle! Maybe this shows that, in relation to the first message, the aliens have a strong understanding of mathematics in geometry?

The beginning and end of the message consists of repeated strings of 10 1s and 10 0s. The break in this sequence tells us where the glitch is: it's the second line. Throughout the second line we see two 0s repeated - this is likely to be a break. If we count the number of 1s between each break, we get the sequence:
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
<br>
This is the Fibonacci sequence. So why, of all sequences, have they sent us this? It is not a sequence used in many processes or calculations. Its properties are often found throughout nature, but beyond that, it has very little use. So perhaps these aliens are simply trying to demonstrate their mathematical prowess to us.

The second line, counting 1's, reads 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55. Digits with a multiple of ten can be found where there is a single zero seperating the 1's.
The fibbonacci sequence has frequent occurance throughout the world, such as the golden ratio, Phi (1.618...). The fibbonacci sequence simply adds the number before in the sequence to the current number. as the sequence progresses, if you divide a fibonacci number by the previous number, it becomes closer to the golden ratio. 
The golden ratio can define many beautiful proportions in the world. For example, the reproductive geanology of a Male drone bee follows the fibbonacci sequence. Furthermore, Spirals in nature, such as in flowers and pineapples, follow the golden ratio and fibbonacci sequence. As this is true, it may very well be likely that the alien race have similar flora and fauna to our planet.
What does this mean? Does this mean that the aliens have a far higher understanding of the mechanics and beauty of universe? do they understand why the sequence is so vital?

The signals originated in the summer triangle section of the sky. The number Pi is very related to circles and the number phi (a derivative of the Fibonacci sequence) is related to how circles and triangles interlock. Also one of the stars in the triangle is called Phi which suggests they are trying to send as many clues as they can about their location.

The sequence follows a fibbonacci sequence if read in the same way as previously. the sequence is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. 
<br>
It then becomes 10111 which should be 13. If we assume the 111 is 3, 10 is their code for 10. The next number is 1101. 1 represents 1 and 110 represents 20 making 21, the next number in the sequence. The next number should be 34 but is represented as 11101111. 1110 is therefore 30. In their tens, the aliens use 1, 11, 111 and so on, but with a zero afterwards. This should means that for their hundreds, there will be 2 zeros afterwards. ie, 181 will be 1001111111101

Decoded, this signal comes out as 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,65: the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence. It is encoded in much the same way as the last transmission, which ten '1's and ten '0's surrounding the broadcast. There is again a break of 00 between terms. The fibbonacci sequence is mathematically important as dividing two consecutive terms gives an approximation of the golden ratio, which is echoed in natural forms, eg nautilus shells and sunflower patterns.

By taking the second row, as it has already been realised that the first and third lines indicate a new patter signal is coming, and then eliminating all the double zeros, the Fibonacci sequence can be found. Up until the number 8, it is simple as it is just the number of 1's, however after this, you add the units after the single zero in the sequence to the two digit number before. So, for example, for 10111, you add the 3 1's to 10 to get 13. This leaves us with the sequence, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 , 21, 34, 55

The Pi-gressives(1):
The cipher is yet again using 1's but with some alterations. The 1's indicate up to 10, indicating a base 10 system. Then, tens are represented by a 1 for each ten then a 0 to separate the units and tens column, e.g. 10111 is 13.
Hence, we have the Fibonacci sequence in our code (the double zeroes are spaces):
<br>
1 - 1<br>
1 - 1<br>
11 - 2<br>
111 - 3<br>
11111 - 5<br>
