It's a Trap!(1):

Using a binary converter, we can see that in the code we have numbers within the pattern showing that the aliens have similar numeric values to us. However, the unknown area might be their own language.
<br><br>
 If we use these numbers as mass numbers from our periodic table, we can see that the pattern may have some significance. Despite this, we have an anomaly; 8225.

Today’s signal was received by the radio telescope at Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory (HartRAO) in South Africa. They are like 
optical telescopes; however, they detect radio waves instead of visible light. The antenna is often shaped like a dish. There are a lot of different 
radio telescopes as there is a large range of wavelengths in the radio wave section of the spectrum. As the frequency of the detected signal is 
1420MHz the wavelength is shorter than 30cm and therefore it is usually detected by a dish under 90 metres in diameter. The second broadcast was 
at a frequency of 142MHz which means the wavelength was less than 3 metres and the dish would need to be at least 100 metres in diameter. It is 
harder to detect radio signals now as we use radio signals for everyday things which interfere with the receivers, so the HartRAO telescope is 
likely to be more accurate to the telescopes in the UK as South Africa isn’t as built up as the UK.<br><br>
<br> <br> 
However, you should be able to see the star HD 185269 from Earth through an optical telescope. Light enters the end of the telescope which is 
focused on the star; the light hits the back of the telescope which is a concave mirror, which causes the light to focus on a mirror angled at 
45 degrees. This mirror then reflects the light into the eyepiece so you can see the image. This telescope allows a clearer image than a Galileo 
telescope and you can also view stars further away with more magnification by increasing the diameter of the back mirror, usually by fitting 
together smaller hexagonal mirrors as it is very difficult to create one single large mirror. This means scientists are able to see the star 
which the extra-terrestrials’ planet orbits.

The Fractals(3): <br> 19:33 <br> More dubious maths.<br><br>

Well, if one takes the disturbing idea that the aliens are solely targeting us, which may indicate a greater amount of malicious 
aforethought, as if one truly wanted information, then it would be sent to a greater area. Using the power estimate from my Voyager 
post, as this one is a) useful and b) more ingenious, it is possible to make a rough estimate. -66,824,706,000KWh<br><br>

I will do this thrice. This will be rather inaccurate, knowing my calculations.<br><br>

I. Assuming the aliens are broadcasting directly at Earth:<br><br>

I will take the liberty (ie lie) of saying the earth is a sphere. So for the aliens, the surface of our planet will 
appear to be circular. Therefore, I will calculate the surface area thus.<br><br>

A=2*pi*r  The radius, say in metres, is 6,371,000m<br><br>

Therefore the area is 2*pi*6371000=40030000m^2(4sf)<br><br>

Earlier, I calculated the total surface area of a theoretical sphere, 153 light years in diameter. This came out as 2.633*10^37 m^2.<br><br>

Therefore the Earth's surface area would be 4.003*10^7/2.633*10^37 of the total.<br><br>

This comes out as roughly 1/657756682488133899575319000000 of the area. Therefore it would require ~1.016*10^-1515KWh (4sf) 
or ~1.016 femtowatt-hours. This is highly imporbable, as it would certainly not be possible to see the planet Earth 
from such distance, without very detailed measuring equipment. Also, they would not know that it was Earth (hopefully). 
Also, there would be huge problems directing a wave over such distance without great loss of energy and a lot of scattering, 
so they would need more energy and power to send such a signal than this estimate.<br><br>

II. Assuming the aliens are broadcasting directly at the solar system:<br><br>

I will not pretend that our solar system is a sphere, for Kepler will turn in his grave. 
Therefore i will say that it is an ellipse. I shall present the area of said ellipse using 
estimates of the Kuiper Belt, as that is a decent enough estimate.<br><br>

The Kuiper Belt is estimated to range from 30 to 50 AU <br><br>

The area of an ellipse is a*b*pi, so that gives us 4712 AU^2 (4sf). One AU equals 149 597 870 700m, so one AU^2=22379522917973918490000m^2. 
Therefore the area is 105452311989493103924880000m^2 or 1.055*10^26m^2(4sf).<br><br>

So the area of the Solar System over the area of the theoretical sphere is 1.055*10^26/2.633*10^37=1/2.496*10^11<br><br>

Which would give a theoretical amount of energy to broadcast of 0.2677KWh, more feasible. This is more likely, but again is 
not that probable, as again there would be amounts of scattering and loss of the wave's power, so it would require more power, 
also, there is the matter of inefficiency on behalf of the broadcast, and again, the problem of aim, as waves tend to spread 
out a lot. <br><br>

III. Assuming the aliens have targeted the area of space we are in, the (theoretical) Oort Cloud:<br><br>

As the Oort Cloud, is mainly a theory, there are many estimates to its extent, I shall do two: 50,000AU 
and 100000AU ( or 7.480*10^15m and 1.496*10^16m respectively(4sf)). I shall assume circular nature <br><br>

1) Thus the area is (7.480*10^15)^2=5.595*10^31m^2 (4sf)<br><br>

This over the surface area of the sphere is 5.595*10^31/2.633*10^37=1/470600(4sf)<br><br>

So a theoretical energy would be 66,824,706,000*1/470600=142000KWh(4sf)<br><br>

2) Thus the area is (1.496*10^16)^2=2.238*10^32m^2 (4sf)<br><br>

This over the surface area of the sphere is 2.238*10^32/2.633*10^37=1/117600(4sf)<br><br>

So a theoretical energy would be 66,824,706,000*1/117600=568200KWh(4sf)<br><br>

The latter two seem the most likely, as this would require a considerable amount of power, 
yet be sustainable, it would also make sense with the lack of precision. Referencing back to 
yesterday, if 66,824,706,000KWh is equivalent to 176 days from a nuclear power plant then 142000KWh 
and 568200KWh are equivalent to 0.0003740 and 0.001497 days respectively (4sf). These would seem more 
feasible, and would still put the aliens ahead of us technologically, albeit more by the 153 year gap 
between teh sending and receiving of the siganl. However, it would be worrying about the implications of this
 - once one considers that for this, the aliens must have known our location, through means unknown, 
maybe earlier electromagnetic emissions, 153 years ago, at the least, and specifially sent a transmission in reply, targeted 
directly at us, one's thoughts turn to a more suspect or sinister motivation, than pure curiosity and research. <br> 4 points <br> <hr>

Lunartics(3)<br> 19:21 <br> 
Perhaps the life forms attempting to communicate with us are interested in knowing how sensitive our equipment is, 
hence sending a transmission within the initial transmission of Pi, as well as sending it at a far lower flux 
density (only upto 3.30 Jansky) compared to the other transmissions. This is an indicator that they know much 
more than they are letting on initially and it is possible that the Fibonacci sequence and Pi were the 'tip of 
the iceberg' in terms of their actual understanding of science and mathematics. It is possible that much more 
data is masked by the first two transmissions as a whole, which is an extremely optimistic view for scientists 
to take. Perhaps looking deeper into these transmissions and looking at the energy which would have been required 
to transmit the messages, scientists may uncover something much deeper which is currently beyond human understanding 
or not yet discovered. 
It is likely that many more patterns and ciphers lie underneath the coding in the transmissions.<br> 2 points <br> <hr>

Nice Dynamite(3)<br> 17:16 <br>The aliens’ use of SPDF notation implies that they have knowledge of quantum mechanics and the 
Schroedinger equations. This suggests that their understanding is much more advanced than ours, and when they 
provide more information in the next couple of days, they may be sharing science understanding we do not currently 
possess with us. The difficulty of decoding the signal has increased in the last three days, as has the knowledge 
required to understand the meaning of the string of numbers. Therefore, we don’t know if it will be possible for 
humans to understand the message tomorrow.<br><br>

They are also likely to know about nuclear fusion and stability, as the element may be on the theoretical 
‘island’ of stability. This would mean that it is likely that the aliens use nuclear fusion or fission as 
a source of energy. If they were to share their knowledge with us, we may be able to develop our use of 
nuclear power as a greener energy source.<br><br>

We also suggest that the fact that this signal occurred as a fluctuation within a digit may be significant. 
Because it was just a fluctuation, and the sequence of numbers is more likely to be a coincidence than the digits 
of pi or the Fibonacci series, and the signal was not a correct representation of the structure of an atom, it 
is possible that this was just a coincidence.<br><br>

The time at which we received the signal provides further evidence for the length of the day 
being 22 hours and 44 minutes, as the signal was received 1 hour and 16 minutes earlier. We first suggested this yesterday. <br><br>

The choice of format which they have been sending the signal in is also interesting. 
If their science and technology understanding was sophisticated enough, they could have 
hacked into our computer systems. They didn’t do this, either because they didn’t want to 
appear hostile or didn’t know how to do this. They also chose to send it as a series of pulses 
of different lengths, whereas they could have used different strengths to represent a different number.<br> 3 points<br><hr>

Several teams have made extensive and impressive calculations about the power required to broadcast these alien signals. 
Each time the result has been a huge number - one I think is extremely unlikely. Apart from anything else, the impact on any nearby spacecraft, 
space colonies etc would be horrible!
<br>
But what if they are not broadcasting to the whole of space, but simply beaming a focussed message to
 us? Then the power requirements would drop by the ratio of the beam-size to the whole of the sky. Perhaps by a factor of 1 million.

<br>
But why might they be targetting us? Well, we have been targetting them and know that they have at least one planet going round a 
star like ours. So, presumably, they can do the same and want to let us know that they have identified our Solar System as a very 
likely place for life and want to say "hello"??

Researching the frequency of 
the signal (1420MHz), this is referred as the Hydrogen Line or the 21cm line. It was been found that neutral hydrogen can give a 
radiation of 1420MHz due to two narrowly spaced levels of energy in the lowest (or ground) state of hydrogen atoms. The result 
of this is a wave that can penetrate clouds of dust in space,a dot hereford signals can be sent with very little interference. 
Indeed, in the 1950's SETI Physicists found the Hydrogen Line to be very effective for searching intergalactic signals. With 
this in mind, it is unlikely the signal sent could have been 'damaged' in transit, and much more likely that the atomic anomaly 
is not a mistake.

Yesterday the fractals explained that the amount of power 
required to send the signal to us would be huge at around 66,824,706,000KWh.As the fractals continued to explain this is 
likely to be putting a huge amount of strain on the natural resources on their planet or that they have developed their 
technology to a point where it is easy to generate such a large amount of power, as a result they may be using technology 
that we have been unable to harness such as fusion to generate their power. However they simply could just have a surplus 
of fossil fuels to burn and are so determined to find other life forms that the impacts to them are irrelevant. They may 
be putting their curiosity of finding other intelligent life forms first instead of researching technology that we have 
put first such as medicine. In other words we have both have different technological roots that have influenced how 
advanced our technology is in certain fields, for example they may have little knowledge of medicine (in comparison to us) 
but have a much larger knowledge of space travel, intergalactic communication, telescopes etc.  (in comparison to us). 
It is also possible that they have a larger planet than us or even have space colonies stretching over other moons or 
planets. This could solve many of the extra-terrestrials problems as it would solve many of our problems. If they 
were to have a space colony they would be able to travel to planets or moons and reap them of their resources for 
example if they found a moon such as Saturn’s Titan Moon where it has seas of liquid hydrocarbon and where it rains 
liquid hydrocarbon because it is so cold there, if they were able to travel to such places they would have a huge 
number of resources and therefore a huge supply of power. If they have more space available to them they could have 
more power plants, more large EM telescopes more transmitting dishes which will allow them to send out signals 
to a larger section of the universe were they are more likely to find life and send signals to other life forms. 
With more space they will have access to more resources and will be able to utilise land more for essential 
activities such as farming. If the extra-terrestrials have cheaper food then they will be more productive and 
economically stronger enabling research on a larger scale further enhancing their technological capabilities.


<br><br>
But why is this relevant to today's code? Well thanks to Team Mitchells break through on how the code 
is likely to resemble the orbital structure of the atom and how they later discovered that the sum of the 
sequence is 132 suggesting that they have discovered element 132. This leads to further questions about the 
extra-terrestrials planet. If they have discovered element 132 then one of the possibilities is that element 132 
may be naturally occurring on their planet. If this is a possibility it is then likely to mean that other heavier
 metals such as uranium which are fairly rare here on earth are likely to be more abundant on their planet. 
If this is the case then this suggests that the extra-terrestrials will have more fuel for fossil fuelled power 
stations allowing for greater power generation. As well as this because their planet may have denser metals 
valuable metals such as uranium may be as common their as coal is common here. Therefore the aliens would of 
experimented with uranium earlier and discovered its uses in fission. The sooner they have been able to discover 
fission would have resulted in its development and use on a large scale sooner. This is likely to result in them 
using nuclear power on a large scale and so would have the power to transmit the signals they are sending as 
commonly as we are receiving these signals. All of this we can infer from how they may of perhaps discovered element 132.

In analysing the code, we can find a sequence of numbers that give comparisons to our atomic 
structures on Earth - 2 2 6 2 6 2 10, 6 2 10, 6 2 15 10, 6 2 15 10, 6 2 10. We can group numbers to match this to numbers of electrons 
in our atomic structures (2, 8, 8, 18, etc...). However we believe that the life-force sending these messages have either a) a differing atomic structure to ours  - 32 reads as 33 electrons in this code or b) made a mistake with the message. It may be that the modulation has caused this glitch - that the number '9' may need to be omitted, thus allowing us to read 15 as 14 (as in base 9).

<div align="left">With the change in Janskys, I decided to investigate the amount of power being broadcasted.
<br><br>
One Jy=10^-26W/m^2*Hz
<br><br>
These claulations will be a bit rough and clumsy, and i have decided to keep the Hz ( bandwidth) constant for the calculations, as i don't know what it is in this signal.  The signal is of strength 3.3 Janskys now. So that is 3.3*10^-26Watts/m^2*Hz. Assuming an equal broadcast in all directions, this would cover the surface of a sphere 306 light years across. 
<br><br>
If one converts 153ly to metres, squares it and multiplies by 4pi, the area of the sphere is given as 2.633*10^37 m^2 to 3 dp. So if we multiply this by the Jansksy equation., we get this
2.633*10^37 m^2*(3.3*10^-26Watts/m^2*Hz)= 868835290989W/Hz (0dp)
<br><br>
As the flux density decreases proportionally to the square of the distance, if, for instance, the sphere were 1m in radius the Watts/Hz across the entire sphere's surface would be 1.820*10^48 (3dp)W/Hz, or for 1/4pi of it, i.e. 1m^2 1.449*10^47W/m^2*Hz. This is obviously a huge amount of power needed to make a signal this noticeable. Obviously, the calculations are far from perfect, but these give a rough estimate of the amount of power generated to create a signal which has a higher flux density for Earth than many stars in the Universe. So, either it may be closer, and not from the star system which i earlier predicted, as it would need huge amounts of power, or the aliens were very advanced ~153 years ago. Interestingly, the flux density of these signals have increased today (i am not doing any more calculations for any other signals) so there must be a cause: either a new greater amount of power was available, or possibly a situation there escalated. There seems to be little reason why, but this could take some more thought.

From Team Mitchell's claim that the code describes the electron structure of an atom with 132 electrons, we have found that it would be called untribium, and would be a superactinide. Like many other heavy elements, it is likely to be very unstable, though it could be within a region of stability, and is likely to oxidise to +6. Feynmann's interpretation of the relativistic Dirac equation suggests that neutral atoms cannot exist above the 137th element, so it is possible for this to exist in a neutral state.
<br><br>
However, the signal shows us orbitals with 15 electrons, compared to the expected 14 which can be found in f-orbitals. Therefore, is it possible that all of the speculations are wrong, and they are not actually trying to show us the structure of an atom? The use of 3 '0's instead of 2 after '10' further suggests that this was not the intended purpose of the message. Of course, it is possible that their natural elements contain 15 electrons in an orbital. Considering how the number of electrons in a non-outer shell orbital in its natural state is normally even, due to the Pauli exclusion principle, and electrons naturally occupying the lowest energy level. We find it unlikely that this element would have these properties, seeing as they are close enough to send us this signal, so the laws of physics are unlikely to be different.
<br><br>
It is possible that this element is not naturally occurring, which would be evidence for the alien's far superior technology. They could have created an element with 132 electrons, and somehow found a way to put 15 electrons in one orbital. Regardless, this would have been a much more recent discovery for them than pi or the Fibonacci series, so it is very possible that tomorrow, they will send us information about something we have never heard of before.

After compiling the data into a bar chart with each value having a width 
of one a shape begins to appeared from the data provided. Assuming the 
final value of 10 symbolises a reduction then we can repeat the message 
only treating each value as a negative - basically copying and pasting 
the graph we already have below the x-axis (graph 1). If we smooth the 
curve slightly then it begins to form a sine curve. (graph 2 and 3).

There are several things that make this exciting:
* It contains the possibility that these extra-terrestrials could use 
trigonometry. This shows an advanced knowledge of circles because an 
accurate approximation of pi is quite difficult to achieve and the use 
of sin is common in more advanced forms of mathematics.

* The fact that this was a message inside a message is quite impressive. 
To encode your message whilst leaving the original readable is a very 
difficult feat. Humans have tried similar ideas for many years through 
the use of steganography but we have mainly used fully digital media. 
For example encoding a message in a picture. To do it with a signal is 
much more difficult and suggests an impressive intelligence.

It is possible that the main content was not meant to be an atomic 
structure, that we misinterpreted it.

<div align="left">These heavy elements that seem to be on the exo-planet that we are obtaining transmission from may have been produced in the supernova that has left the Cygnus Loop as a remnant. There are some ideas that this supernova was in fact a hypernova and so would have much more energy than a standard supernova and would therefore be able to produce heavier elements than uranium.<br>

The heavier elements may also have been produced in greater amounts after the supernova -and so there would be a greater proportion of heavy elements in the planet, when it was formed. This may have made experimenting on these heavy elements much more possible for the life forms on this planet as they would be much more abundant, hence they would be more likely to discover the element that we currently consider to be theoretical in the 8th period of the extended periodic table. However, when looking at the electronic configuration of this apparent element, 15 electrons appear to be present in the f orbital, rather than 14 which is our belief. In the string of 1s and 0s that were transmitted where there appears to  be '15' electrons - the one 1 and five 1s are separated by one 0 this could indicate that they could want us to do 15-1 = 14. Although the transmission of 15 could be a mistake by the 'aliens' ...<br>

The chemistry being encoded in the number 9 of the transmission of pi, suggests either:<br>
1) they have nine periods on their 'periodic table'<br>
2) fluorine has some significance to them, as F has an atomic number of 9<br>
3) they work in base 9 rather than base 10 as was previously assumed - which they then perhaps converted to base 10 for our benefit, indicating that they may have been observing us.<br>
4) they work in base 10 but 9 has some other sort of significance<br><br>

When all the 1001 strings in the transmission were converted from binary into decimal system and then when all the remaining strings were converted, the sequence was as follows:<br><br>
<br>
1, 9, 9, 15, 9, 9, 15, 9, 9, 0, 15, 9, 9, 0, 15, 9, 9, 0, 15, 9, 0, 31, 9, 9, 0, 15, 9, 0, 15, 9, 9 followed by twelve 0s once again.<br><br>

The occurrence of multiple 9s in this sequence suggests that 9 has a strong mathematical value to this species.</div>

Ultra Enigma(3)<br>
11:48<br>
Ok, the aliens sent us the electron configuration of an atom (albeit with a mistake in the number of electrons in an f-shell). The electron configuration of an atom, though, is not that simple. The standard way we talk about how electrons are arranged is 1s2, 2s2 and so on, but this is a simplification which makes it easier for chemists to do their work. In reality, electrons behave according to the laws of quantum mechanics. Why then did they choose to send us this model of reality. Does it mean that their chemistry is more advanced than their physics (they may not even know about quantum mechanics as on earth the quantum revolution occured quite unexpectedly). Also, why would they be more anxious to tell us about their knowledge of chemistry than any other discipline. Over the past days , they sent us information on Euclidean Geometry, Number Theory and now chemistry. We humans would generally send maths then physics and then chemistry because those are the subjects we know most about. This provides further indication that the aliens have more advanced chemistry than physics (or that they value chemistry above physics) in which case, because chemistry on earth is much less developed than physics, we could exchange knowledge about physics and chemistry with them. Also, the fact that the aliens live on a mush bigger planet than us, they must have stronger skeletal structures to withstand the gravity or perhaps even an exoskeleton. On the other hand, Jupiter sized planets are usually gas giants. This perhaps could indicate that because the aliens have no solid ground on their planet, they could have developed ways of floating on the air like baloons.
<br><br>
Also, in the last code, the aliens used 10 to represent 10. In this code when they have d-orbitals represented by 10, they are followed by 3 zeros. This is inconsistent with the last messages where spaces were indicated by 2 zeros. In fact if we read the code the way suggested by last message, we'd read 100 and not 10. There are now 2 mistakes in the message (the inconsistancy with others and the 15 electrons)

The code's resemblance to the outer structure of an atom seems to indicate that hidden somewhere in the message is a reference to a specific atom or element. Team Inifinity decided to research the significance of the number 9 and subsequently found that it is the atomic number of flourine- a higly toxic gas and the lightest element in the halogen group. Perhaps this another clue to help us piece together the composition of the atomosphere of the planet from which this species originates. Or maybe they are trying to communicate information concerning their own biology/anatomy in that flourine maybe be their essential gas just as oxygen is ours...?
<br><br>
As well as being a representation of the element flourine, the significance of the number nine may be interpreted differently... Before Pluto was officially designated as a non-planet, there were nine planets in our solar system... It should not be too surprising that the aliens may know this due to the advanced intellect and scientific awareness that they have already demonstrated. However, to add to this- nine is also the number of months over which a human pregnacy normally lasts. This may be yet another indication of the aliens' extensive knowledge of human life and the planet Earth.

<div align="left">If the signal does show the structure of an atom then it is one slightly
different to what we would recognise. This suggests one of the following:<br><br>

  1. We were wrong<br>
  2. They're wrong<br>
  3. The atom they are talking about is not present on Earth<br>
  4. The message was corrupted by some event and this is just interference<br><br>

The first or third possibilities are extremely exciting to scientists, 
because either of those two would mean that our knowledge expands. Is 
that not what science is for?<br><br>

Possibility 2 seems less likely as to have the ability to send signals 
like this you need to be relatively intelligent.<br><br>

The fourth possibility could be true as we have evolved to see patterns 
that do not exist. An example of this is when we see the outline of 
people or faces when some objects are arranged in a particular way. 
However it seems unlikely that interference would only effect the digit 
'9' in the original signal and would do so in such a way that it was 
written in a similar form as before.<br><br>

To know which one of the above it is more needs to be known about those 
who sent it.</div>

6s2 6p6 6d10<br>
7s2 7p6 7d10<br>
8s2 <br>
This gives us a total of 132 electrons, this can either be a isotope of an element or an element it self, however we have not yet discovered an element or isotope this big on earth. This shows that the aliens have a good understanding of physics and chemistry on an sub atomic level, which in turn suggests they posses the technology to explore such things.

Atomic orbitals are the areas inside an atom where the electrons are most likely to appear (also known as shells at GCSE level). We say "most likely to appear" because as proved by theories of quantum mechanics an electron is not simply a charged ball. It can also behave like a wave. These theories are still relatively new to mankind, suggesting that the aliens are more scientifically advanced then us because they understood the atom and their signal had already been sent (assuming they are at least 150 light years away as predicted by the majority of teams) before we even knew the properties of the nucleus of the atom.
<br><br>
The number of atomic orbitals varies depending on the period of the atom. Today's signal shows that the aliens have a strong understanding of chemistry and physics theory as they sent the exact configuration of X132, which to human knowledge would be far too unstable and have far too short a half life to truly exist. Atoms with more protons than 118 were hypothesised in the Extended Periodic Table (which has 8 periods, not 7) however there is no proof that these atoms can or ever will exist. This makes the alien's choice to send us this exact sequence surprising, unless because of their larger star, (HD 185269) and supernovae in the past they are aware of heavier elements, and this mythical 8th period.
<br><br>
Using the code 2,2,6,2,6,2,10,6,2,10,6,2,15,10,6,2,15,2,1 and Team Mitchell's discovery that it is the orbital structure of an atom, it could be a new undiscovered element, or in fact be listing several different elements. They usually write them use previous elements be fire the shell configuration which uses small numbers which work in the sequence. Doing this you get helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon which is 2,2 6,2 6,2 10 6, 2 10 6. After this it doesn't work as you can't have 15 electrons in the second one, so after this point the aliens must have some elements we have not discovered or do not exist on Earth, with 15 electrons in a shell.

We break the code using 00 as spaces and we get:
<br><br>
2, 2, 6, 2, 6, 2, 10, 6, 2, 10, 6, 2, 15, 10, 6, 2, 15, 10, 6, 21. This gives us 141 in total, which is the mass number of praseodymium. Also, Compton scattering is linked to 141keV X-Rays, which is used in synchotrons. Hence, this delves into radioactive decay and explores the possibility that the aliens are aware of nuclear power.

There's a pattern of 22626216216215162151621 after which there are twelve 0s again. We assume the twelve 0s means that this is the end of this particular transmission as all past transmissions have ended with twelve points
<br>
If you find the mean of these numbers, you get the square root of 9 - the number which these values encode.
<br>
After looking at it in more detail, it does appear to look like an electronic configuration - 1s2 2s2 2p6 etc ... However, it appears to go past an atomic number of 118 - Uuo which is the heaviest metal element on our Earth that has been discovered. The transmission is either telling us that there is another element for us to discover or they are telling us so,ething about element s on their own planet. (The exo-planet orbiting HD 185269)
<br>
Because this exo-planet is a Jupiter sized planet it is likely to have a stronger gravitational field than we have on Earth which has the potential for heavier metal elements to be more abundant.

We can confirm that the delay since the previous signal was 22 hours 44 minutes, and the same for day 1 to day 2. This seems to confirm a shorter day length than on Earth. Also, this implies that their planet is either closer to their Sun, or orbits at a much faster speed than expected.

We have looked at the relationship between the quantity of numbers and the 9th signal within Pi. There are 21 numbers and we tried to rearrange the numbers as if they were part of a transposition cipher but with no success so far.

the outer structure of an atom is 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d10 4p6 5s2 4d10 5p6 6s2 4f14 5d10 6p6 7s2 5f14 6d10 7p6... Taking the numbers after the letters, we get our code! This means that the aliens have a firm understanding of chemistry, and furthermore subatomic physics. However, in our current periodic table, we have no element with 132 electrons (sum of all numbers in sequence). Could this mean that the aliens have discovered a new element? This could mean that in Cygnus, there are much denser elements than on earth, much denser than the current heavyweights Osmium and Iridium on earth

We decided to look at the actual form of the binary sequence which led us to believe that the deciphered version is as follows 2,2,6,2,6,2,10,5,2,10,5,2,15,10,5,2,15,10,5,2,1 which shows us from the graphs below that it is a binary conversion an input which then can be transferred into orbital structure of an atom.

This is presuming that higher denominations are formed in the same way as before.  Also note the interesting almost constant cumulative frequency, with plateaus.<br><br>

If we look at the three zeros as a space between phrases, we get 2262621, 621, 62(15)1, 62(15)1, 621<br><br>

The repeated pattern of 621 and 62(15)1 could mean that these phrases correspond to letters in which case we'd get a 5 letter word<br><br>

abccb<br><br>

where a corresponds to some letter which the aliens represent as 2262621<br><br>

in this word, the second and last letters would be the same and so would the third and fourth.

There is a strong repeating pattern of '11001100' and '100001111' throughout the sequence. If 1100 represents a single number or symbol, for example, a space, then this could very well be a sequence of some form. Conversions using ASCII and hexidecimal have prevailled no results. It would follow logic that this signal will follow the same format as the previous two, but who is to say it is? this sequence seems to follow a much more rhythmic manner.

The aliens see binary in a way which uses 0s as gaps and divisions between 1s. Everyday the way that the 0s are used becomes more complex as if they know that it would take us a while to understand and to give us time to build up our knowledge on how the signals are sent. In the first signal only double 0s were used to signify a space between numbers. in the second signal double and single 0s were used, the single 0s being used to divide two parts of the same number. Today sets of 4 0s are being used but so far no one is certain what they represent although using the same techniques as before the message appears to read 2, 2, 6, 2, 6, 2, 1, 6, 2, 1, 6, 2, 1, 6, 2, 1, 6, 2, 15, 1, 6, 2, 15, 1, 6, 2, 1 which as yet is not recognised. Could it be of mathematical importance beyond our current knowledge.
This series of signals might be an intelligence test to see how far our understanding has gone and if we fail who knows what they may do to us?
