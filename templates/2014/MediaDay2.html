It has been brought to our attention here at News for Science that several psychics are claiming to know we 
are under attack. Among the science community it is clearly a hoax, however the general public seem to be
willing to accept this. This news has sent some regions into a hysterical outbreak, with many people 
attempting to create safe rooms or simply evacuate. "We as a planet are definitely not under attack", 
says Professor Neutrino, and said that if there are any new developments people will be informed. The 
governments are trying to contain this hysteria to no avail, one citizen who wished not to be named told us, 
"Psychics are never wrong, never I tell you! If they say we are under attack then we should believe them, not 
the scientists!". Extra police are being drafted in to contain the most volatile regions, with people looting 
shops for food and other supplies in case of a disaster. All of us here are urging everyone to go home and 
watch some awful midweek TV, and keep up to date with the news as it is about to get even more exiting! <br> 1 point <br> <hr>

Earlier today at 10:00am another code was released this time the signal was received by the 
LOFAR experiment in South Africa which has a large array of radio telescopes. As has already 
been reported the code has been identified to contain the Fibonacci series which confirms that 
the signals sent today and yesterday must have come from some form of intelligent life 
somewhere in or close to the Cygnus constellation from which the signal came from. With 
this now more solid knowledge that this signal is a result of intelligent life scientists 
have already began observing the orbits of planets where the signal could of possibly come 
from to see if it is possible for life to exist there. For example scientists from the team 
known as Mad Dynamite have started to question if there is enough light from some of the suns 
in the constellation to provide enough energy for organisms higher up the food chain to exist 
which are more likely to be intelligent life forms. If the food chain does not extend that far 
then only simpler beings may exist on the planet and so will be unable to have the intelligence 
to communicate with us in the manner of communication which we have received. Besides these
 radio signals have to travel thousands of light years to reach us.<br> <br>

By the time we have received these a great deal of time would of passed for the extra-terrestrials 
further complicating the story. Of course even if we do receive a signal of perhaps the co-ordinates 
of where the planet broadcasting the signal is it would obviously be at this stage impossible to 
travel to the planet, that is unless we can communicate and send signals back to the extra-terrestrials. 
Theoretically we could start to converse with the extra-terrestrials which would allow us to perhaps 
learn of new technologies that could change the world we live in and eventually help us to even visit 
the extra-terrestrials planet. Of course the ‘we’ in this is unclear. Most people would expect NASA 
to have the main role in any possible communication with the extra-terrestrials however some may insist 
the UK space agency takes the lead in communication since Jodrell Bank did pick up the original signal 
which in turn meant that the LOFAR experiment could point their radio telescopes in the same place as 
the Lovell telescope did to receive their signal. Either way if we are able to communicate with the 
extra-terrestrials the fight over who on the entirety of planet earth is to be allowed to communicate 
will undoubtabley last for years and may even result in a potential second cold war or even war itself.<br> <br>


In other news relating to the signal after we were warned yesterday be Russian authorities to stop 
broadcasting information relating to the code we as a result of not stopping were raided by Russian 
authorities this afternoon. However clearly they were not as they stated were looking for drugs after 
they had a ‘tip off’ that we were drug traffickers which is of course false as when we returned from 
the raid without surprise the equipment we needed to broadcast the information had been taken. But we 
were not beaten. We crossed the Russian border into Ukraine where we have another studio to enabling us 
to broadcast this post. Since the code was released the civil war in Ukraine has intensified as rebels 
blame the government for censoring information. More on the global impact of these signals tomorrow.

Adaptations of the Extraterrestrials from Cygnus: <br> <br>


Looking closely at the star HD 185269 from which the signals appear 
to be originating, we can see that it is a system of a single exoplanet, 
HD 185269 b. The planet orbits the star at an average distance of 0.077AU, 
much closer than Mercury is to our Sun. However despite this, it is an unusually 
large planet for it's orbit, with a mass similar to that of Jupiter.<br> <br>


The star HD 185269 is similar to our own Sun, with a G spectral type and a mass 
1.28 times the mass of our Sun, with a very similar luminosity, according to the 
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Due to its proximity to the star, this exoplanet is 
likely to have extremes in temperature, similar to that of Mercury. This would mean 
any life forms present on the planet would need to have adapted to both withstand 
extreme heat and extreme cold. The likelihood is that these creatures can be classified 
as either daytime or nocturnal life forms, adapted to the extremes in heat and cold 
respectively. Due to the extremely short orbital period of this exoplanet of 
approximately 6.8 Earth days, there is unlikely to be much fluctuation in the 
form of seasons on this planet. The extremes in heat on this planet are likely 
to cause problems, due to the lack of the availability of water, hence the life 
forms will have adapted to survive with very little water. As for where the water 
is found, this is most likely to be deep underground or at the poles of the exoplanet.<br> <br>


The large size of the planet is indicative of high mass, 
hence the exoplanet is likely to have a strong gravitational field, 
which is more than enough for it to have an atmosphere. This would shield 
the surface from harmful radiation from the star, including gamma and x-rays, 
as well as allowing for weather. The gravitational field strength at the surface 
will also be much greater than that of the Earth, so life forms will have evolved 
with sufficient muscular strength for movement, and are therefore likely to be much 
larger than life forms on Earth which are adapted to a much weaker gravitational 
field in comparison.<br> 2 points <br> <hr>

Earlier today the signal from the extraterrestrial beings was tracked back and the source was found to be in 
the constellation of Cygnus. The signal has come from the planet HD 185269 b which orbits around the star HD 185269. 
It is 153 million light years away from us making the idea that they will visit Earth anytime in the future an 
unlikely concept, as that would require far superior technology to ours. However, over the last two days there 
has been record numbers of sales in telescopes and binoculars as amateurs all over the world turn to the skies 
to try to view the star. According to officials at Jodrell Bank the star is viewable from Earth through 
household binoculars on a clear night. If you look under related links you can find several maps of Cygnus 
and the sky to show where the star is and to also show where Cygnus is positioned in the sky at certain times. 
If you are interested in viewing the star there are also nightly meeting of most astronomy clubs in the country 
with renewed interest surrounding the aliens. The weather forecast for the next 3 nights sounds promising with 
little cloud in England, Northern Ireland and Wales. There is some cloud in northern Scotland, but there is more 
chance of clear patches tomorrow night, giving some opportunity to view the star. We'd love to see comments and 
photographs, so write in or tweet! <br> 2 points <br> <hr>

This is a news bulletin from Norwich News to confirm that the photograph below, published in multiple newspapers and social networking sites across the globe is not real.
Mr Cameron spoke to our news correspondant this morning and clearly stated 'I shake hands with hundreds of people per day and although I can surely not remember all of them,
I have no recollection whatsoever of shaking hands with an alien'. The photograph has sparked global panic as people flee their homes. The artist - Norris Nova is due to apologise
publicly this afternoon but emphasises that 'The whole thing was a joke, given what's been said on the news about intelligent alien life. The fact that a human and an alien are pictured
shaking hands just represents that perhaps we are more similar than we think'.

Good afternoon.<br><br>

Today we wake recognising, with much clarity, that we are not alone.<br>
Not alone in this expanse of space and time.<br>
Not alone in this vast volume of dust and vapour.<br>
We are joined by others who share our passion for science and meaning.<br>
We have no indication that the beings who have sent these signals mean any harm.<br>
Instead, it is likely they wish to know more about us.<br>
The signals indicate that our little orb is visible to them, that our galaxy’s motion and orientation is known.<br><br>

This is an exciting moment for humankind.<br>
We should look forward to our next correspondence so we better understand this life form.<br>
God bless the United States of America.<br>

<b>The Scientific Layman - Debunking Fiction from Fact</b><br><br>

Although many have speculated about the intentions of the aliens in various magazines (such as the Turing Times and Infinity News), there has to be a boundary - the facts. As of current knowledge, we only know for sure that the aliens have sent us a message, regardless of the intent. After many years of evidence-based reports, the Scientific Layman wishes to introduce the analysis of current information received by us from the extraterrestrials.
<br><br>
Are we Under Attack?<br>
"Right now, the only thing we are under attack from is a barrage of coded messages from an alien source" says Dr. Fractals. Dr. Fractals specialises in extra-terrestrial exploration and identification. "I understand that there is panic of attack, but a hostile species would not let itself be known before attack, as that would give us a chance to defend against them." Fractals went further to explain that to send such beautiful concepts of mathematics, namely the Fibonacci sequence and Pi makes it highly unlikely that we are dealing with a threat.
<br>
But not everybody agrees. The possibility that we have been (and still are) being observed by alien life haunts even the most fearless of men. "They sent us something we know about, and in exactly the right direction!" claims Dr. Nuck Chorris. "All planetary orbits are 'tilted'. Even a slight tilt makes sending and receiving messages accurately very difficult, if not impossible. This means that the alien form we are dealing with is far, far more intelligent than we are."
<br><br>
What Do They Want From Us?<br>
<br>
Given the limited information about the aliens, we are currently unsure. They could potentially want to simply communicate with us and test our intelligence - after all, it has been out of our interest to search for other life-forms. However, there is a very real possibility that the aliens are simply calculating our precise position and have sinister intentions for us. This could happen - but it would take at least 150 years for them to reach us if they travelled as fast as light.
<br><br>
Government Warnings<br>
The Prime Minister has recommended that people stay indoors to avoid potential abduction. All authorities are trying to locate any nearby extraterrestrial life-forms, in case they already know where we are. In any case, remain inside and safe, and do not panic.

Scientists have received a second signal at around midnight from, what they believe to be, extraterrestrial life. The signal originated from the star HD 185269, within the region of Cygnus. The many teams working to understand these messages quickly decoded it as being the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence, with the next term being determined from the sum of the previous two terms. There is much speculation among the science community as to what this could mean, with some scientists believing it points to a second world much like our own, and others thinking they are demonstrating how mathematically advanced they are by testing our equipment and knowledge. 
Fibonacci is something found everywhere in nature, from the number of petals in a flower to how our cells are arranged in our body. This sequence gives the most stable arrangement, which is why it is so prominent in nature. Everything is essentially maths. We literally wouldn't be able to survive without this fundamental concept, which has most probably been used long before there was even a spoken language to communicate with. It is universal, hence why the alien life has been able to communicate with us, without a common language. However, if mathematic constants and sequences are the only way to communicate, how are we really going to know what message they are trying to convey? Are they warning us of our impending doom? Or just simply curious about other life in the universe as we are? Whatever the reason, scientists are hard at work decoding the signals as we speak. 
The whole world is gripped by this fascinating story, which was once just science fiction. A little fun fact, Sir Patrick Moore once believed there were little green men residing on Mars. Two years ago, he also predicted that extraterrestrial life would be found outside our solar system in under 50 years, according to various sources. It has come a lot earlier than he expected! 
I think things are about to get a lot more exiting, don't go too far in case you miss the next report of the alien life!

<b>The Alien Conspiracy</b><br>
Following on our report from earlier a few people have come up with their own ideas about the extra-terrestrials hovering above our planet. Conspiracies have always been popular, but now people have something real to talk about.
‘If they have been watching us maybe they have been on Earth the entire time,’  Michaela, 22, remarks. ‘Maybe they have been here since human civilisation first started, we don’t know.’
The potential idea that aliens have been around since near enough the beginning of time is a rather alarming idea, especially for Jack who reckons ‘they’ve been spying on us. If they’ve been spying on us they’re going to kill us. We’re done for.’
But it’s not just people worrying about aliens spying on us. People have emailed in talking about conspiracies that this is a government hoax, how it’s a trick planned to worry us all. Others talk about how they must be our ancestors, that Fibonacci himself was an alien sent to give us an early message from our otherworldly friends.
Mark Woods of the ILFTA (Interstellar Life Forms and Threats Association) says ‘The aliens may be harmless, they may be harmful, but I see it as pointless in coming up with conspiracies so early. It is only day two of communication with them. We need to give it time before we come up with any ideas. We may be able to establish a connection soon; we may not in the next one thousand years’.
To add to the ideas of conspiracies Doctor Jane Doe reports, ‘I feel disappointed people are jumping to conclusions already. This could quite possibly be the greatest discovery of the 21st century. The government has nothing to do with this, this is purely a Turing University research operation and we are as eager as everyone else to discover the truth behind the aliens’.

It has been stated over and over again that whoever is sending out these signals is more advanced in maths and science then we are. If this is true then maybe this message wasn't sent a few centuries or millennia ago. It might have been months, weeks or even days. We have based all our findings on what we know the laws of physics to be like. In WW2 the Manhattan project showed us that a theory to split an atom could be achieved then whats to say other theories can't also be proven correct? In 1967 Gerald Feinberg coined the term tachyon. For those who don't know a tachyon is a hypothetical faster then light particle. It is possible that this sentient race has found a way to create a tachyon drive. In theory this gives them the ability to travel faster then light. If that is possible who knows how long it might have taken for the message to have reached us. The bigger problem facing mankind is that if they do have the ability to create and harness tachyons then they have the ability to create a warp drive craft. This may not be too different from the Alcubierre drive designed by Miguel Alcubierre. If it is possible to travel faster then light then whats to say these extra terrestrials don't know how. One of the largest problems of warp drives is the energy to power it. Exotic matter is required to fuel the reaction. We do not know how to create let alone harness exotic matter. The closest we have come is to create antimatter in the antiproton decelerator at CERN.If we can create antimatter what can a species with possible millennia of scientific advances do?
The possible planet from which the signal was sent HD 185269 b is a hot-gas planet. This planet is very similar to Jupiter. Jupiter has a gravitational force two and a half times stronger then our own. This would mean if there is any life on that planet it would have had to evolve a much more powerful skeletal system to what we have. As stated by a previous group the temperature is also very different to ours.

A signal was detected from Star HD185269, located in the Cygnus constellation. This yellow main sequence star has a similar characteristics to our own Sun, including spectral type, and mass and possibly luminosity. This begs the question, was the signal sent from a life form on the planet that orbits this star? 
<br>
After speaking to Professor Joe Bloggs from Trinity College, Cambridge – a leading astrophysicist, it is likely that, if a life form did send this signal, they will be more advanced than us as a human species, because of the proximity of the planet to the star causing “extreme conditions”. 
<br>
Signals have been received at both Lovell and LOFAR in the past month, originating from this region and they have been translatable to the number pi as well as the Fibonacci sequence – this gives Professor Bloggs reason to believe that this life form is highly intelligent, at least equal with us, if not above us, because they are transmitting frequencies entailing complicated in depth knowledge of sciences. Professor Bloggs hypothesises that due to their apparent knowledge in sciences, coupled with the likely extreme conditions on their planet is further reason to believe in their being more advanced than us. 
<br>
What does this mean for our race? Will this potentially existing life form contact us again? Do they ‘come in peace’? Or will we have a bigger problem than global warming and a failing economy?
<br>
We will keep you updated as more transmissions come in.

In response to yesterday's panic over the possible threat of an Alien invasion following two glitches in a signal being received, which, when interpreted correctly resemble the Pi sequence; the LOFAR experiment, an array of Radio Telescopes, has turned its attention on the signal. The telescopes have picked up yet another glitch in the signal, this time using the Fibonacci sequence. This is yet another example of possible extra-terrestrial intelligence and their understanding of our numerical system.  Still, this may not be an attempt to invade our planet, merely just to contact us. They may be like us, curious as to if they are alone in the universe, or if there is more intelligent life out there. Scientists reassure us that the signal come from the constellation Cygnus, which is thousands of light years away, meaning that any signal sent must have been sent thousands of years ago and therefore would take thousands of years to send one back. This fact raises questions, such as is the sender of the signal still out there? Do they still want to contact us?  Do they already know we're here? Only time will tell.

Following another signal from extraterrestrial origins, interests have been piqued regarding the reason behind the whole debacle. It would appear that the aliens are inquisitive, as they have used a different frequency, perhaps as a test. 
After yesterday's debates over the aliens' counting system, more data has come to light from the LOFAR experiment. It would appear that the aliens indicate different denominations with breaks of different durations. There are rumors that their society is mathematic-centred, with several scientists quickly noticing the occurence of the Fibonacci series. Before this spirals out of controls, here is Bob, with a very interesting viewpoint.

'I can't believe it! More signals from different parts of the world! The aliens are trying to distract us. With every soul on this planet watching for more maths, they'll strike. I know they will. We're doomed!'

Across the world, scientists are wondering what will arrive next, with many favoring more universal 
mathematics, but others think communication is due.
The world's new religions are grasping tenets form the broadcasts: 
latest trends include eating pie and keeping rabbits. 
World grass shortage ensues as rabbit population grows exponentially.

The world's philosophers now confront a new Universe, with many claiming that the aliens do not exist. They Kant quite believe it.

World markets have changed today to accommodate new alien based wares. Many supermarkets have started stocking extra food, as 
panic buying is not over.
Some scientists have predicted a logarithmic spiral will lead us to the alien planet.
Covert military 
action has been rumored, commanded by a Major. It is suggested that they wait in orbit to defend us. Ground control has since

<b>Aliens: Harmless or Harmful?</b><br>
Continuing on from the report from yesterday, another code has been received from the aliens. According to the scientists they use maths based communication, similar to how we work which could possibly mean that they have been observing us for quite some time. Maybe they're communicating with us in this certain way to tell us that they mean no harm and want to connect with us, or maybe it means something completely different.
A code was broken earlier today by Turing University, and was revealed to mean the Fibonacci sequence, a sequence of numbers created by adding the previous two numbers beforehand. An iconic sequence in modern day maths, it has become quite well known, and so clearly if the aliens could pick up on communicating with us they'd do it with iconic numbers.
Some assume this may be because they want to show they are harmless by sending us a simple sequence that we are familiar with. Maybe it also shows they are familiar with maths and are an intelligent species, so we will easily be able to communicate with them. As quoted by Doctor Jane Doe from Turing University 'We can assume the aliens are in fact intelligent. We have already established that as they have clearly created an advanced form of space travel, but now we know that they use maths similar to us we can easily communicate with them. We can connect with them and understand what they want. This is a great opportunity and we cannot let it pass'.
But, is the opportunity really worth grabbing? If the aliens are in fact intelligent it doesn't necessarily mean they're kind. What if the Fibonacci sequence means nothing to them but they have been observing us, simply plucking something they know is of relevance to us to use for communication. Mark Woods, head of the Interstellar Life Forms and Threats association had this to say:
'[The aliens] could very well be dangerous. It's clear to tell that they are indeed watching us. They may wish to simply create a bond with us, or they may wish to destroy us. They may be up there learning our weaknesses, examining the best way to exploit and destroy us when they can. If we have established they are intelligent, more so than us, then maybe they have the ability to wipe us clean from our own planet. If they are communicating with the Fibonacci sequence, which was discovered in roughly 1200, they could have been watching us for over 800 years'.
To further emphasise that the Fibonacci sequence has been in use in art since 450 BC, so maybe they have been watching us for a lot longer than 800 years.
It has also been established that the aliens possibly could also be humanoid in shape. As stated by other researchers at Turing University we can assume '[the aliens] count in base ten, if they do understand the Fibonacci sequence'. This also brings about the possibility that the aliens have ten fingers, due to us having ten digits being the main reason we count in base ten. If they have ten fingers they must be humanoid in shape, further backing up the idea they are possibly a long distance ancestor, or maybe a mutated form of human from a 
failed space mission.
Either way, they may not be as harmless and as safe as they seem. So it is recommended to be wary and complete everything on your bucket 
list ASAP , because we might just be invaded at a time earlier than any of us expected.

In a unique investigation by ENCA, a South African based media outlet, it was determined that we may have been watched. '142 mhz is the common frequency of earth based radios. This could indicate that the aliens are trying to communicate specifically with us and not some other civ because they knew we'd pick it up.' This was according to Neil Turok, leading South African physicist. 
<br><br>
'This indicates that the message couldn't have been sent 6000 years ago because we didn't use radio then and they would have seen no point in communicating with us.' Turok then went on to stress the scientific importance of this. 'Therefore, their planet is much closer than 6000 light years. In fact, if this is true, we only started broadcasting radio waves around 1900. The time between then and now (114 years) should be divided by 2 to produce the time it took for the radio waves we sent to reach the aliens and the time it took for their replies to reach us. Thus , the aliens can't be more than 57 light years away!'
Of course, this initiated intense argument in the scientific community because we don't know of stars 57 light years away in the direction that the signal came from.

Conspiracy theorists have taken the chance to have an 'I told you so' moment. In the American midwest, hundreds of insurance firms have been flooded with claims from supposed alien abduction victims saying the new discoveries of other life in the universe substantiate their claims. In fact, in the area of Las Vegas, huge anti government protests have occured. ENCA journalist Jeremy Maggs was on the scene.
<br><br>
'This is unacceptable!' was the comment from one man covered in tinfoil. The protestors are demanding that the the US government reveal the location of Area 51 and admit to having known about the aliens 50 years ago.

The second message received today was the Fibonacci sequence.
Conspiracy theorists all over the world have come to the conclusion that these messages are not the first time we have come into contact with these aliens. in 2006 a crop circle at Badbury Castle in the UK was in fact a spiral which followed the Fibonacci sequence. The great pyramid of Khufu in Giza was intentionally built by using the number pi.  Other examples are Stonehenge. believed to have been a perfect circle. The Parthenon has ration equal to 1.618 or the golden ratio. We are surrounded by these numbers and sacred artifacts that have no recorded history. Most ancient civilizations have gods or deities that they worshiped. Could these be aliens? Stories from Christopher Columbus seeing lights in the sky on his voyages. In medieval art there are depictions of disk shaped crafts. There reports of Cigar shaped crafts during the black plague. Our history is surrounded by aliens. The lost city of Atlantis believed to be created by aliens. What if aliens have always been among us? Statues in Easter island of humanoids. Then the ancient Mayans who somehow had knowledge beyond their years. Leonardo Da Vinci a mathematical genius and inventor centuries ahead of his time was he an alien? was he getting help from aliens? 
government cover ups. Up until recently Area 51 was one of the most gaurded secrets in the world. The Roswell indecent in 1947. Or the UFO of the first and second world war.

Based on the Extraterrestrial Signal observed on the night of the 14th/15th of July, Astronomer Dr Lae Jenkins has made groundbreaking connections between the Astronomical Patterns found in foreign galaxies and the Natural Fibonacci Sequence that occurs on Earth, most noticeable in flowers. She hypothesises that the observed spirals in space, when coupled with the signal sent from the aliens suggests a common interest in the natural mathematics of our universe. She quoted in an interview this morning: 'The aliens may simply be searching for intelligent lifeforms on earth, who may have a further understanding of the way the universe works. Before making physical contact and trying to visit earth, they are testing us with the signals to see if we can correctly interpret them and thus test our knowledge and how useful we will be to them. The only question is, what will they send next?'

Following the news of a second translation of extra-terrestrial signals received by the Jodrell Bank Observatory, 
the scientific and public communities alike have been whipped up in excitement. Many news corporations have been sold stories 
of people coming into contact with alien life on Earth, using descriptions based on the widely-held (though some believe far-fetched) 
belief that these life forms have ten arms, tentacles, or fingers. Consequently, the Jeremy Kyle Show has been inundated with requests 
to participate in the programme, after many families have been torn apart by their dispute over the meaning of the signal, and their 
views on whether or not these aliens are real. One man, after falling out with his family, said that he felt "alienated" (badum-tish).

Meanwhile, there is further debate over the purpose of this message. Scientists are asking the question, "Was this message sent to us? 
Or did we simply happen to receive it?" In November 1974, scientists broadcast out the Arecibo Message, in the hope that it might possibly 
make contact with alien
 life in the star cluster of M13 (In travel news, the M13 is suffering heavy delays at the moment). So is this signal something similar, 
or is it a conscious attempt to contact humans, specifically. If so, then how did these aliens know of our existence, especially given that, 
with the large distance that the signal has travelled, it must have been sent thousands of years ago? If they did know about us that long ago,
 who knows how far advanced they are compared to our species, and what preparations they may have been making to travel here in the meantime? 
And, finally, people are wondering, if we did receive this by chance, whether or not we should respond. Our generation will be long dead by 
the time the reply reaches the aliens, so it will be our descendants who have to live with the consequences - whatever they may be.
The next 
thing to ask is: what next? The aliens have sent us pi, and now the Fibonacci sequence. So some are saying that instead of lingering on this signal,
 we should instead be thinking about what curiosities the next might contain, and how to ensure there is less commotion than in response to 
today's signal.
Finally, some people are asking what the scientists at Jodrell have been doing if they couldn't crack a code that took a 
group of schoolchildren less than 10 minutes.

The mysterious 'angel' image causing confusion 
and chaos across the globe is now believed to have an explanation. The outstretched wings and cross-shaped body are thought to be an attempt 
to represent an image of a swan – an interesting discovery, given that the signals being received by observatories across Earth originate in 
the Cygnus constellation, with 'Cygnus' coming from the Latin for 'swan'.
The swan image is believed to be a confirmation from the intelligence 
sending the signal that it definitely originates in the Cygnus constellation. On closer observation, the two 'extra suns' that appeared in the 
sky over Turkey are the two small stars that make up the telescopic double star 'Albireo' – the bright star found in the 'head' of the Cygnus 
constellation. This confirms the beliefs of many that whatever sent these signals wants to make sure we know we’ve got the right place, and 
evidence of the senders' intelligence has been found in the form of the signals sent being representations of both Pi and the Fibonacci sequence. 
It is unknown how these clues are being transmitted to Earth, or whether the other strange events occurring presently are intended or simply a
 side effect of the transmission of signals. It is also unknown what part the massive explosion preceding the signals played in the plans of 
whatever is sending the signals, but the most popular theories claim it was some way of producing the huge amount of energy required to send interstellar signals, much as nuclear fission reactions produce energy on Earth. The fact that the frequency of the detected signal has dropped from 1420MHz to 142MHz suggests a decrease in energy, possibly supporting the theory that a large amount of energy was produced and is now being used up in sending the signals. The fact that the frequency has decreased by a factor of 10 could also support the theory that whatever is sending these signals is aware of and intentionally using the base-10 system.
As an aside, the commercial plane that appeared briefly in a Bromley shopping mall yesterday has made a reappearance 'somewhere above the M3'. Multiple people at different points along the motorway reported seeing the plane for varying amounts of time ranging from a fraction of a second to a reported 40 seconds before vanishing. The significance of this plane is as yet unknown, but a several witnesses claimed that the word 'Phaethon' could be seen faintly on the underside of the plane. Rumours that the plane is the missing Malaysian plane remain unconfirmed.

Conspiracy theories are flowing in torrents from all manner of media around the globe(apart from those countries which have banned it of course. Some say that the Fibonacci sequence means that Mona Lisa was of alien origin as the picture was painted using the proportions of the Fibonacci spiral, some say that it means much more important things. Religions everywhere were shocked into a state of worry when the idea came out today that due to how the Fibonacci sequence is found in all aspects of life; the extra-terrestrials could be telling us that they created us and all life on earth. What this means for humanity and everything that we have ever held to be true in relation to religion, nobody can begin to guess at.

The newest data signal recieved by the Jodrell Bank Observatory has been confirmed by experts to be a binary representation of the Fibonacci sequence. Coupled with the previous signal, which was revealed to be ten digits of pi, the scientific community now believe they have real evidence that whatever is sending the signal is not only intelligent, but wishes to communicate with us and may have awareness of the human race.
Cryptologist Dr. Smith of Oxford University claims that these two signals could not have been produced accidentally. "The chance that the source produced a signal corresponding to pi and the Fibonacci sequence is practically impossible. These are highly precise mathematical ideas and are solid evidence to suggest that whatever is out there is trying to communicate with us. It's likely that their knowledge of the human race is negligible, as their signals don't correspond to any known human language, but the language of mathematics is universal. This suggests very strongly that whatever is sending the signal is aware that there is intelligent life in this area of space - and that we have the tools to recieve and decode their signals."
Another extremely significant fact revealed by this discovery is the signals' use of the base ten system. Experts suggest this implies one of two things: either the intelligence sending the signal is aware that the base ten system is the most common system in use on Earth, or that the number ten has some significance to the sender. A possible, although slightly far-fetched, explanation could be that - like humans - whatever sent the signal has ten limbs or body parts of some kind, just as humans have ten fingers. The discovery that one of the only planets near the area the signal originated - the Cygnus constellation - suitable for life is a "hot Jupiter" planet with a gaseous surface means that human-like life is perhaps unlikely, but the question remains: could something out there be trying to tell us something?
