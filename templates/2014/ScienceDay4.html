Aphelion(3): <br><br>


So, what have we learned since Monday? The first two broadcasts told us that the aliens have a strong base of mathematics. We also know that they have a relatively advanced understanding of particle physics and genetics. From this we can deduce that they are intelligent beings, but this is all old news now.
<br><br>
What should we do with this knowledge though? How should we reply? Death Star suggested sending a comprehensive message, however surely it would be more productive if we sent something in a similar style to their code, so sent at a frequency of either 1420 MHz or 142 MHz. We suggest that we should not overcomplicate these first attempts at contact, so instead of trying to send our alphabet we should send responses similar to their messages, so numbers of mathematical significance. We suggest we send Euler’s number ( e ), the Avogadro number, the exact electron configuration of hydrogen and oxygen, a sequence of square number and the exact DNA of a human. If we receive any more transmissions then we will add a relevant response.
<br><br>
For two of their messages, we have sent direct responses clarifying the details of life here. They could understand our DNA and compare it to their own, and hopefully they would recognise the most abundant element in the universe, and the element it joins with to create water. Water is especially significant because we believe that life cannot occur without it. The aliens chose to send the Fibonacci sequence, which is probably the most significant sequence in mathematics and thus any sequence we send in reply would be “sub-standard” as it were. This could even lead to the aliens thinking that we are intellectually inferior. Likewise, the Avogadro number is a less complicated concept than atomic orbitals, however the alien’s choices of what to send seem like they are challenging us to better them, which with our current state of academia, we cannot.
<br><br>
So, should we wait to reply until we have a better knowledge of our universe? Well, the signal will take 153 years to reach the planet we believe they inhabit, so surely it is better to get something sent so that both our civilisations can embrace the fact that we are not alone.

The Fractals(3): <br><br>
Looking back over at the DNA coding, it would be impossible to tell in the transmitted form which base '1' corresponds 
to: uracil or thymine. There may not be too much of a distinction to make: thymine is just a methylated version of 
uracil; however, there is a difference (generally), thymine is found in DNA, while uracil is found in RNA; the 
difference between the two is the helical structure: DNA has a double helix, while RNA only has a single; this 
also gives their role in cells: DNA is a store of information, whereas RNA decides which strands of DNA to use, 
mimics it and instructs the ribosomes (although this will be separate molecules).<br><br>

It is currently believed that in the early stages of our world, RNA existed in great amounts: being easily 
sythesisable, and these attempted to survive. So, RNA could be more important, and is seen as a pivotal 
art in cell by us. But, if these, as suggested by Team Mitchell, among others, aren't coded, but the DNA 
bases are, it may suggest that a) the DNA is seen to have a greater role by them, b) they may not have as 
much knowledge of RNA or c) life developed differently on their planet, and RNA was not needed. The earlier 
stages of their planet would be quintessential to discover this, but alas, we know alien genetics not that well.
<br> 2 points  <br><hr>

The Pi-gressives(3): <br><br>
As a comment on what we should send - an 'expedition' has been mentioned. Unfortunately, this is ludicrous! 
It would take an object 150 years to reach the alien planet at the speed of light, let alone a satellite/object 
that is rather chaotically sent into space at fractions of that speed.<br><br>

The only real and plausible option to send messages by is using similar radio frequencies of 1420 MHz or 142 MHz - 
or to (immediately) invent a space warping machine that can either form wormholes or bend space in front of it and 
expand space behind it to move.<br><br>

If the latter were possible, it would be a good idea to send an airtight packet of some of our "biological content" 
so that they don't decay - e.g. a human brain slice or even seeds. This would allow the aliens to gain an insight 
into our biology. We could also send some form of entangled particle so that we can communicate instantly - e.g. a 
split photon, so that as soon as they alter the outcome of their entangled particle, we receive a result, such as 1's 
and 0's so that we may communicate without worrying for 150 years at a time.<br><br>

As for the base sequence, it seems strange that a silicon based species would send us amino acid coding so similar to ours, 
unless they are trying to show that we are actually being observed by them right now (they may have already reached Earth 
if they set out early). However, it could be that they are carbon-based, but then it would be a big risk for them to send 
out information to a species who they think could possibly be silicon based, as it could potentially mean nothing. <br><br>

One last thing that is surprising is that these aliens have managed to message Earth 4 days in a row. Firstly, they would 
have to be sure that they were aiming in exactly the right place - they would have to take into account orbital tilt, 
they orbital movement, planetary rotation and even solar system rotation as it slowly moves around the galaxy.<br> 2 points 
(alas quantum mechanics doesn't allow faster than light transfer of information...)<br><hr>

Nice Dynamite(3): <br><br>
Following on from Lunartics’ observations earlier, we have been analysing the choice of fluctuations. Yesterday, 
it was in ‘9’, and today, it was in ‘8’. This leads to the possibility that it may be in ‘7’ tomorrow. However, 
we don’t know what ‘7’ is. There is no 7 in either pi, the Fibonacci series or the numerical DNA sequence.  So it 
is possible that, tomorrow, the signal will be completely new. Of course, the fluctuations may not actually be 
signals meant for us. We are still not entirely sure what today’s shows, other than amino acids, and yesterday’s 
signal was incorrect. Therefore, this may have all been a coincidence.<br><br>

In the past few days, we have received messages about maths, chemistry and biology. Therefore, it is likely that 
the message will be related to physics. Suggested topics include general relativity or string theory, as these 
are advanced topics, which will provide them with a way to further demonstrate their intelligence. Perhaps they 
will even give us information which will tell us directly about them, rather than the obscure messages they have 
been sending us in the last few days.<br><br>

Our research shows that this planet was discovered in 2006. It also shows that it takes 6.84 Earth days to orbit 
its sun, which we can call a year. This is roughly 164 Earth hours, which, using our assumptions from earlier, 
would equate to 7.2 alien days in a year. As it is unlikely that they would not have an integer number of days 
in a year, if they are like us, they may round this number down, if they use this system at all.<br><br>

We also have to ask how they have produced advanced enough technology to send out these signals, if their 
planet really is a hot Jupiter. We are doubtful that it would be possible for intelligent life to live there. 
We have yet to find any intelligent life on Jupiter, the planet in our solar system which this planet is most 
similar to. It would be even more difficult for life to thrive on this planet, a hot Jupiter. It orbits closer 
to its sun than Mercury, so the temperature would be incredibly high. It is also a gaseous planet, so there would 
be no stable surface for life to live on. Maybe they are actually living on an undiscovered moon? Maybe a spaceship 
in the area of that solar system?<br>3 points<br><hr>


The Fractals(2):<br><br>

Earlier, we have decoded the transmission to reveal a list of genetic codons, 
grouped by result. Therefore, we can conclude that carbon-based life is possible on the alien planet, so it cannot be the gas giant present. 
We have assumed that the bases used are the same as the human genome, credit to Team Mitchell, therefore adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine/uracil 
must best present, but they are very similar, as a uracil-methane reaction would produce thymine. Form this we can deduce a lot of things about the past 
of the alines' life. 
<br><br>
Firstly, we can deduce that they are most likely eukaryotes, i.e. their genetic code is contained within cells, as we decoded 
the starting codon as AUG, a starting codon, which mainly occurs in eukaryotes. Also, it is highly unlikely that any organism which can gain the sentience
 and knowledge displayed by the aliens is single-cellular, which is the general size of those which have their genetic information free-form within the cells.

<br><br>
Secondly, it is very likely that their home is terrestrial in nature, as chemically, the bases need four elements present: carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen 
and oxygen, and in most gas-giant and smaller gas-based planets, either hydrogen, or, eg Neptune, nitrogen, carbon is lacking. So it becomes even more unlikely 
that they are form the observable planet. 
<br><br>
Thirdly, assuming a terrestrial planet, it may have had a similar formation to the Earth. So it may have been, 
for lack of a better word, volcanic. So we could probably deduce what chemicals are. The needed elements are carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen. 
In volcanic situations, predicted chemicals needed would be carbon monoxide, methane, ammonia and water. Like early Earth. 
<br><br>
So the alien life is 
therefore likely very similar to Earth life, if their genetic structure a) exists and b) is of the kind they demonstrated. (Also, we could probably deduce
that they have a number of most things which is of a power of two, i.e., for humans, 32 teeth, 8 fingers, 2 thumbs, 4 limbs, 2 eyes, etc, due to the way cells 
and lifeforms reproduce, by splitting into two, which gives a natural tendency to have numbers based upon powers of 2). Below are a few pretty pictures of 
mapping of the genes implied of the transmission and the human genome, from my teammate.

Infinity(1):<br><br>

Yesterday, a series of pulses, within the signal which earlier 
this week was revealed to represent the number nine ,were discovered. Today a different series of pulses were detected within the signal which was confirmed to 
represent the number eight. Team Infinity picked up on the aliens' use of these two numbers for their hidden messages and are wondering why these two numbers 
in particular were chosen...
<br><br>
Today's message was interepreted as a demonstration of the aliens' knowledge of the genetic code, therefore if we relate 
this discovery back to the use of numbers nine and eight- the possibility that these two numbers were used to further the idea insinuated 
through this message seems valid.
<br><br>
Maybe the aliens are communicating details of their own genome...? The genome of a normal human being is made up of 23 
pairs of chromosomes- therefore 46 chromosomes altogether. It is possible that our extra terrestrial friends wish to convey that their 'alien' genomes are 
composed of 98 (9,8) chromosomes or maybe even 98 pairs of chromosomes. It may also be reasonable to think that the 'alien' genome has 72 (9x8) or 17 (9+8) 
either chromosomes or pair of chromosomes. Who knows?<br>

AlphaBeta(2):<br><br>

These signals. We have been making conclusion about what 
they are and why they were sent and all these delicious thing. But one question that has been bugging us is were we supposed to get this message. Did they 
know we were here? Did they just shoot it out in all directions hoping to get lucky. Or Have they been watching us? have they been able to see where we are 
in our evolution? Maybe they knew about us all along but decided to send it now. when they believe we will make the best use of it.
<br><br>
All we are saying 
is be wary of the fact that we received it. Not only that but we also received it in a form we could read,understand and decipher.

Tomshanoenyu(3): <br><br>

Some codons are separated by ten 0s and some are separated by 2 0s. However as we can see at the end of the glitch codes for day 1, 2 
and 3 the code ended with the following 000000000000. There are 12 0’s here. So by the end of day 3 we concluded that the aliens must signify the end of their 
message through sending 12 0’s. However on the fourth day the code this time ended with the following 000000000000000, there are 15 0’s here. Perhaps this is 
just an error caused by some interference as it was travelling and the extra-terrestrials intended it to end with 12 0’s. This is because the code on day 4 
was considerably longer. Perhaps the 15 0’s represent some kind of punctuation that the extra-terrestrials use to signify the end of a line. This would not 
of been used on the other 3 codes since they are not as long as the code on day 4 and are therefore not lengthy enough to be in sentences therefore they would 
end it with the same 12 0’s that perhaps signify the extra-terrestrials equivalent of a full stop. If this is the case then 15 0’s may resemble the aliens 
punctuation for ending a paragraph; punctuation which we do not use in the English language. <br><br>

The use of punctuation may suggest that the aliens 
communicate in a similar way to us and that they therefore have to take breaks when speaking. This need for breaks suggest that the extra-terrestrials 
similarly to us need to breath similarly to how we need to breath when speaking causing us to stop speaking therefore bring about the full stop and comma. 
This suggests that the extra-terrestrials are similar to us in this way which also supports how today we discovered they sent us DNA fairly similar to our 
own. If this is their DNA then it is likely that they too have to breath in a similar fashion to our own which may even mean that we have a similar anatomy 
as we both may have lungs. Of course we know that all organisms need to respire so this is likely to apply to the aliens too unless the biology in Cygnus is 
completely different to how it is here which is unlikely from the DNA coding they have sent us.<br><br>

In conclusion we can infer a lot from the very little 
information we have received so far from the extra-terrestrials however we can only infer; there is very little if not nothing we can be sure on about our 
extra-terrestrial composers.

Death Star(1):<br><br>

Science post: We've been thinking about what the world should reply to the 
aliens with if 
we beam at them. An obvious starting place is the content of the Pioneer plaque <br><br> See here on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_plaque"> wikipedia </a>.<br><br>
<br><br>
and the Voyager Golden Record. That latter contained natural sounds and pictures, greetings by and pictures of humanity (nudity was
forbidden), music from Bach to Chuck Berry.
<br><br>
We've thought it would be good to include an anatomical picture of humans ala Pioneer since the world is not so prudish now.
We'd include a bar graph showing the relative masses of the sub-atomic particles including the higgs boson to demonstrate
our knowledge level. Some Beatles, Rolling Stones, Nirvana and Lady Gaga should be added to the music list. 
<br><br>
We should start planning a solar sail expedition to the alien star system too.

The Pi-gressives(2):<br><br>
The aliens most likely have not coded uracil. What is surprising about this is that mitochondrial DNA (in humans) contains around 2 unique molecules of rRNA (ribosomal RNA), 22 molecules of tRNA (transfer RNA) and some polypeptides. The key point of this is that RNA is based around the nitrogenous pyramidine Uracil instead of Thymine. Hence, although it seems preposterous, it is implied that the aliens lack mitochondrion and so do not respire, or manage to respire by different means (possibly anaerobically, but with a "waste" system to filter out toxic by-products). Another possibility is that - as mitochondrion are effectively symbiotic bacteria - the aliens have an "advanced" mitochondrion variant that consists of thymine instead of uracil bases.<br><br>

Another interesting point is that viruses depend on RNA (mostly), and that viruses 'may' have sped up human evolution by forcing us to adapt to their rapid mutations. It seems possible now that RNA viruses are non-existent on the alien planet, which seems to suggest they managed to vaccinate against them, or they were never present in the first place. The main question is then, how did they originate? On Earth, we speculate that humans started off in a protein mixture, and that DNA could not exist without RNA first being present. Do the aliens have the capability to genetically modify themselves? If this were true, it is possible that the aliens removed the less efficient RNA form from themselves and forced a DNA variant into their code.<br><br>

Lastly, we must explore whether they have a double helix DNA molecule in their nucleoli. Human DNA depends on RNA as it must be semi-conservatively replicated, i.e. split, copied and joined back together, by two single stranded RNA molecules. However, if the aliens lack RNA, they cannot do this. This may mean that although the aliens have discovered the same nitrogenous bases as we have, they haven't got a similar microbiology.<br>

Team Parallax(2):<br><br>
Because of the life forms knowledge of DNA thy must have similar technology to us such as microscopes. Because there is such a similarity between are DNA and the DNA in the signal this could also hint that they could have human samples meaning they could have been in contact with us before.
Because of the DNA this could give us ideas of what there planet may consist of by thinking of planets we already know, for example on one of Saturn's moons a certain chemical when mixed with water can produces amino acids. This can also hint that the life forms have done expeditions to our solar system.

Nice Dynamite(2):<br><br>
We have used the pulse lengths and the assumed length of a day to calculate the intelligence's time system. Their day of 22 hours and 44 minutes gives us a day of 81840 seconds. Divided by 20000, this gives us 4.1 seconds, which is the length of one of their pulses. We are assuming this is the length of a second, and the 0.4 second pulses are a tenth of a second. There could be 10 seconds in a minute, 100 minutes in an hour and 20 hours in a day, which would make the length of a day 20000 seconds. Alternatively, there could be 100 seconds in a minute, which would make a second 0.41 of our seconds long. Their use of tens in their time system could prove that they are much more intelligent than us!<br><br>

Yesterday, the Lunartics suggested that the aliens actually work in base 9, which would suggest the use of '15' rather than '14'. However, this would mean that they would have written '11' rather than the correct '10'. Also, base 10 was used in pi and the Fibonacci sequence. This means it is unlikely that their suggestion was correct.<br><br>

There is a triplet code with the four bases, which shows that they should have DNA that is similar to that of the human race. The adenine and guanine have a double ring structure and cytosine and thymine both have a single ring structure. When adenine pairs with thymine it pairs via two hydrogen bonds and guanine with cytosine pairs via three hydrogen bonds. These hydrogen bonds will determine the coiling of the DNA molecule and therefore the nature of these molecules. Tyrosine is the start code and then serine would be the end code marking the end of the DNA molecule. We are still trying to figure out what these amino acids show, with them possibly being part of the composition of the aliens or humans (to prove that they know about us).
<br> 5 points <br><hr>

Lunartics(3):<br><br>
There is a chance that the amino acid sequence provided by the extraterrestrials is a mutated protein, that has been affected due to the proximity of the planet to its star and lack of protective atmosphere such as the ozone layer here on earth. This could mean harmful radiation such as x rays and microwaves etc. which could lead to the mutated proteins. If they have similar DNA to humans (as Team Mitchell said it matches Earth DNA), this could mean the transmitted amino acid chain is a common but mutated protein eg haemoglobin, insulin, penicillin.<br><br>

The likelihood of this protein sequence being a mutation of a protein that we as  humans also have is quite high when you take into consideration the fact that previous transmissions have presented ideas such as a base 10 scale, pi and the Fibonacci sequence - all of which are common to our mathematical logic. It is quite likely that these extraterrestrials are very similar to us.<br><br>

If we look at this transmission as just a way for these life forms to present their level of intelligence and how scientifically advanced they are to us, then this could just be a random string of amino acids which they believed would cause us a great deal of confusion if we are not as advanced as them.<br><br> 

This was encoded within the 8 in the Fibonacci sequence which is the sixth number in the sequence in that particuar transmission. This is curious because the 9 in the pi transmission was also the sixth number. This is another possible indication of the significance of the number 6 to there life forms. This may give us a clue to where else in these current transmissions there is more hidden information for us to find, possibly in every third or every sixth digit. Maybe they work in base 6 although looking at the other evidence we have also gathered it seems less likely.

Team Parallax(1):<br><br>
From what the other teams have found it shows that the life forms have a good understanding of amino acids and base pairs in a DNA structure.<br><br>
Also because of the letters this could mean that they know adenine guanine rhyming and cytosine.

RSETI(3):<br><br>
Strangely the people who sent these messages are yet to send something 
which signals a much greater intelligence. I am quite surprised that 
they are yet to send something which has us all completely stumped as to 
what it is. So far everything they have sent has been within our 
knowledge. The only slight exception was the atomic structure, but even 
that was at least intelligible to us.
<br><br>
Everything that has been sent has sort of been expected. The numerical 
system is one that is easy for us to understand, the DNA sent is similar 
to ours and could even be in a double helix structure like ours. 
However, even if it is similar they may look completely different to us. 
For example we share 50% of our DNA with bananas.
<br><br>
What this makes me wonder is whether or not they are more intelligent 
that us. Sci-fi films have always depicted extraterrestrials as highly 
intelligent beings - far more so than us. So far we have seen no 
evidence of that. Obviously I'm not suggesting we base all our knowledge 
of films but it is still a bit peculiar. One has to bear in mind that 
these transmissions were likely to be sent ~150 years in the past if 
other teams are to be believed about the location of who sent it. 
Therefore whoever sent it could have made lots more discoveries.
<br><br>
The other option to them not being more advanced is that they just know 
their audience. This would be really exciting because it means they know 
about us or people of a similar intelligence to us.

Several patterns emerge: namely the fact that codons which produce the same result are grouped together. This is unlikely an actual chemical structure but a list. They are again showing us what they know, this time in the field of biology. If this is a true representation of their knowledge of genetics: then it must a) have been similar to ours ~153 years ago and b) have a similar basis, as these are recognised here on the planet, it is likely that they too are carbon based. On that thought, we return to the aliens' planet. IF this knowledge of genetics is shown, the aliens cannot live on the Hot Jupiter planet, as there are too few elements, namely carbon for this kind of life to survive. So that would seem to indicate another planet a) hidden by the planet or b) of a different planet using a relay.

Ultra Enigma(2):

Another important thing this tells us about the aliens (if indeed it is their genetic code) is that they are carbon based lifeforms. All the proteins in their DNA sequence contain carbon. But could they have their own genetic coding sequence that matches closely to ours but instead of carbon, uses silicone or another element? If they are indeed carbon based, we can assume that like on earth, their is a lot of carbon on their planet.

The Pi-gressives(1):<br>
<br>
The fact that only the numbers 1-4 have been chosen is irrelevant. What is relevant is that there are actually 5 nitrogenous bases we know of, and that clearly only 4 have been encoded to us by the aliens. From Team Mitchell's message, it seems as though they have encoded A, T, C and G, which are responsible for polypeptide coding by the DNA. However, this would imply that they haven't encoded U, which is primarily involved in ribosomal protein synthesis. Also, uracil is involved in the more primitive RNA - often included in viruses - which suggests that the aliens are either unaware of RNA/Uracil or genetically different in that no organisms they have researched contain it.

I found this page regarding DNA coding: http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/courses/27619/codon.html . upon looking at the table, i realised that there were exactly the same number of pairings of triples, and the same number of singles. I therefore suggest that the aliens are not describing a specific DNA sequence, but in fact simply all of the amino acids that we are aware of. There are no differences between our listed knowledge of amino acids in comparison to theirs, and hence it is very likely that they have developed in a similar way to how we, or other animals on our planet, have. However, their evolution has probably been massively affected by the climate, gravity, and environment they were subjected to in Cygnus.<br><br>

Throughout this week the signals receiving us have contained concepts that humans are already familiar with – mathematical functions, chemical elements and DNA sequences. This indicates that the aliens have some concept of our knowledge and may be testing us based on knowledge gleaned from a human source, for example the Voyager satellites that were sent into the universe carrying information about humankind – our DNA, mathematical knowledge and the location of the Earth. Given that the aliens are too far away to survey us, the transmission of a DNA chain similar to that of humans may not indicate that they are similar to us – it may indicate that they have picked up one of the voyager satellites, a notion reinforced by the fact they are able to accurately transmit radio signals to Earth (this wold require knowledge about the Earth’s location given on the Voyager plaque).
<br><br>
Assuming that the DNA is alien, saying that they are similar to us is a great a leap to take, and thus we think that we should remain sceptical as to whether this is actually an example of alien DNA, as they may only be trying to communicate their understanding of our genetic makeup. There is no guarantee that their DNA contains the same number of bases as ours, or that they even operate using DNA all. We should avoid using our preconceptions about the nature of life on our planet to describe the nature of beings we are entirely unfamiliar with.  One suggestion for the use of 3 digits in every string is that their DNA could have a triple helix structure, but we do not believe this is possible. If we assume that that their planet is a gas planet, which we have deduced, their genetic makeup is probably very different to ours, to allow for differences in their biological structure.

What do the extra-terrestrials look like? That is the question on the lips of every scientist on earth as the belief that the latest code is a set of genetic instructions for the extra-terrestrials or a species that they know of. This is being thought by pessimists among us as the genetic code for an extra-terrestrial species that they are trying to protect us against. By sending us their genetic structure we can formulate a weapon to fight them. Most scientists though believe that they are sending us their own genetic structure to work out what they are like. A continuing theory is that this is a great test of intelligence to see if we know how to use the information they are sending us. If this current idea of the number sequence being genetic information is correct then will anyone try to make something out of it? Will anyone manage to create extra-terrestrial cells upon earth? What would happen if they did?
<br>
One big question though is which base does each number represent? If we could work out this then we could figure out what proteins they are made up of. 312, 122, 131, 134, 221, 234, 431, 434, 333, 332, 121, 124, 433, 432, 111, 114, 233, 232, 331, 334, 311, 214, 313, 132, 123, 133, 231, 244, 243, 242, 341, 344, 343, 342, 441, 444, 443, 442, 221, 224, 223, 222, 211, 214, 213, 212, 421, 424, 423, 422, 323, 322, 113, 112, 411, 414, 413, 412, 141, 144, 143, 142, 321, 324. If we assume that 1=U, 2=C, 3=A, 4=G then we get: AUC, UCC, UAU, UAG, CCU, CAG, GAU, GAG, AAA, AAC, UCU, UCG, GAA, GAC, UUU, UUG, CAA, CAC, AAU, AAG, AUU, CUG, AUA, UAC, UCA, UAA, CAU, CGG, CGA, CGC, AGU, AGG, AGA, AGC, GGU, GGG, GGA, GGC, CCU, CCG, CCA, CCC, CUU, CUG, CUA, CUC, GCU, GCG, GCA, GCC, ACA, ACC, UUA, UUC, GUU, GUG, GUA, GUC, UGU, UGG, UGA, UGC, ACU, ACG.

We have only recently understood and proved Darwin's Theory of Evolution, and from this we understand the process of natural selection and evolution over billions of years to create the variety of animals we have today from micro organisms. The code the alien transmitted seems to suggest that they have a very similar genetic make up to us, so we have to question whether there is another factor in evolution we have not yet discovered. The planet is 153 light years away in very different conditions to our own, meaning the likelihood the species on the planet have evolved  to have the same style of genetics as us very unlikely, so maybe there's something we haven't discovered yet which pushes all species to develop in a similar way? This could be a break through in the science world. Maybe they both have species with RNA and those with DNA like the viruses on Earth do. However, as they use the numbers 1 to 4 we cannot know whether they have the same bases as us or not. With different bases the proteins would be completely different, but the similarity between our DNA structure and there's, including 4 bases, is a very interesting new discovery.

This could be any human genetic code.The reason being, upon analysis of the values, it was discovered that there are four different numbers, with in groupings of three.  What this implies is that it is codons, which is the signals that code for the genetic material. Specifically DNA replication, prokaryotic and eukaryotic transcription and translation. Following this chain Proteins will also be synthesized.  So in conclusion it is not simply DNA, it can be any biochemical product that involves 4 Nitrogenous base pairs. At the same token it could also be any one of the many different types of RNA, (rRNA, SnRNA, mRNA etc) , which would hence imply that it is not definitely DNA as the exact nitrogenous bases aren't known.

RSETI(2):

<br>
The fact that the numbers correspond to DNA is extremely interesting. 
The reason for this is that it quite closely follows how we would 
represent DNA which suggests that they have DNA fairly similar to ours. 
Their are the same number of proteins in their DNA as ours and it is 
quite likely, therefore, that they are the same protein.
<br>
<br>
This has a number of consequences. Firstly it implies that life on their 
planet, and themselves, is not too different to the life we find here on 
planet Earth. This is also backed by the way they transmitted the 
message - it is not too far off the way we would do it. All this points 
to the very real possibility to the fact that they are extremely similar 
to us.
<br>
<br>
Another implication is that scientists have always wondered how life was 
started on Earth and one of the leading theories is the Primordial Soup. 
This theory suggests that life began in a body of liquid due to 
reactions in that liquid and the atmosphere. If this theory is correct 
then it is quite likely that their planet is similar, or at least has 
been similar, to ours.
<br>
<br>
There is even the possibility that life did not originate on Earth. As 
there is life similar to ours elsewhere in space it is possible that 
life transferred from planet to planet. Perhaps we ourselves are aliens!
<br>
<br>
Of course, we have to be careful not to jump to too many conclusions. 
This is only a small excerpt from the DNA, if it even is DNA at all. 
Without the full message it is too early to make any firm conclusions. 
Furthermore, for all we know, the people who sent the message may have 
sent something else's DNA. Who's to say that they haven't takebn a plant 
from Earth, gone home and are broadcasting the message back just to 
confuse us. I know I would want to confuse aliens!

The fact that the numbers 1,2,3,4 - code for a base means that the fact that they  are in threes, translates directly to a codon and therefore an amino acid<br>
<br>
Perhaps this is a long chain polypeptide or protein<br>

Aphelion(1):

<br>
The code is a reference to the triplet code in DNA. The three numbers from the amino acid and most likely the amount of triplets on one line of the code shows the formation of a protein with the amino acids. They seem to have four bases like us and so could have similar proteins and amino acids, however our proteins are often more complex than the ones shown. We also need to speculate what these mean as they could be trying to show the proteins which make up their skin, heart or brain etc. The fact that they change the number of “triplets” in a row (not separated by 10x 0) is curious as it could mean that they have significantly shorter chromosomes to ourselves, featuring only a few genes. Or, they could be not describing their own genetic makeup at all, and simply showing us that they understand our own...<br>

It could be possible that each number in the sequence refers to a protein in the aliens DNA. the numbers only include 1,2,3,4's, all of which could refer to each of the proteins U, C, A and G. This means that they could have an understanding of genetics, and could very well be like us!
