Infinity: Many teams have stated and studied the exact location from which these signals appear to be coming. Team Infinity acknowledge 
that the location emitting the pulses is at star Albireo (Beta Cygni) within the constellation of Cygnus which is the Latin for 'swan'- based on the shape of the 
constellation. When observing maps and diagrams of the constellation Cygnus, Albireo can be pinpointed at the 'head' of the swan and it is for this reason that 
Albireo is referred to as 'the beak star.'<br><br>

<img src="/static/2014/Cynus- swan.jpg"> <br>

The relevance of this being the location from which the pulses were sent is dependent on the idea that the aliens' understanding of Albireo as 
'the swan's head' is similiar to that of humans. The chance is slim however is there. If we assume that aliens recognise Albireo in this way, 
the location acts as an interpretation of the aliens' message. If this location was specifically chosen, which is likely considering their level 
of intelligence, the 'swan's head' or 'beak star' could symbolise the superiority of this extra terrestrial species as compared with humans. The 
known distance of Cygnus from Earth gives us an idea of this species' rate of intellectual development ('The Cygnus constellation is 6,070 light 
years away which also enables us to work out that the signal was sent 6,070 years ago?'- Turning Machines) and allows us to piece together fragments 
of their timeline of discoveries (Pi) and inventions (radio?). This somehow supports the 'superiority' therefore also the 'swan's head location' theory. <br> <br>

If this interpretation of their location being deliberately symbolic is valid, the message could be viewed as a threat to mankind and life on Earth- 
especially since this alien species seem to also demonstrate their understanding of the mechanisms of Earth (base 10 counting system, possible knowledge 
of name of constellations) which could back up the whole 'superiority' and also 'we are watching you' theory. <br> <br>

Therefore the aliens may be communicating a threat of invasion in this rather complicated fashion.<br>

ACAR: During the glitch signal, the periods when the pulse is turned on would suggest that the extra-terrestrial life are aware of the number Pi. 
While this is the best explanation it should not be ignored that there is no decimal point signified by the signal so it is possible that it is not meant to show Pi. <br> <br>

By looking at the frequency of the signal we can assume that the life is aware of the 'Hydrogen Line' where neutral hydrogen atoms change in energy state. 
This fact also proves it is extra-terrestrial in origin as the radio waves of this frequency can penetrate through clouds of interstellar cosmic dust. 
Also this frequency may suggest that the planet is located in the centre of the Milky Way.<br> <br>

The use of Pi may also suggest that the life is intelligent and have a similar number system to our own. Also it may suggest that they 
have rivers on the planet as pi occurs in the meandering ratio of a river. However as pi occurs in circles this could suggest that the orbit of the planet is a circle.<br> <br>

As the two glitches occurred 12 days apart this could suggest also that the planet rotates once every 12 days.<br> 2 points <br> <hr>

Infinity: The location emitting the pulses is at Albireo (Beta Cygni) also known as "the beak star" within the constellation of Cygnus 
which is known as the swan in Latin. It uses the binary star system as it is a binary star and hence the binary number system in the message. 
The aliens may have chosen to send the message from this location to inform humans that they are aware of the significance of the number 2 to 
mathematics and human biology therefore once again demonstrating their extensive knowledge of the human world and Earth.?

Lggs12: 
The code starts and ends in the same pattern of repeated 10 ones and 10 zeros, each set of ten lasting 4.1 seconds. 
This is significant to the start and end of the signal. The middle section is an encrypted code representing the 
mathematical constant Pi. We found this by using 1 as a base unit. For example, 111 would be three. The numbers 
were separated by two zeros. The aliens may have used Pi to show that they have knowledge of basic geometry, and 
from this we can imply that their civilization may be based around circles, or example they may have circular buildings. 
Furthermore, it may be a test to find other advanced life forms, because advanced life forms such as humans would recognize 
the significance of Pi as an important naturally occurring mathematical constant. The fact that the zeros and ones before 
and after the glitch are in groups of ten, and the fact that Pi is given to ten significant figures, could suggest that 
the aliens use 10 as a base unit. From this we can imply that there is a significant origin of the base unit, for example 
if the aliens had similar human physiology they may also have 10 fingers as using fingers is a means of counting. The 
signal was found in the range 1420Mhz. This is significant for several reasons. Firstly, this frequency corresponds to 
the hydrogen band which suggests the aliens either have a hydrogen based atmosphere, or they are aware that their sun 
is composed mainly of hydrogen. The frequency could also show how far away the exoplanet is from earth, by finding the 
speed of the signal and therefore the distance from this and the time period. we could also find out how long ago the 
signal was sent, because it would take a long time for the signal to travel through great distances in space, and so 
this signal corresponds to a certain history frame in the aliens development. The signal appeared 12 earth days apart, 
however the aliens might have a different time period for days and years because their planet may be spinning faster or 
slower than earth. <br> 2 points <br> <hr>


Tomshanoenyu:
The message could be a communication request from the extra-terrestrials. The Message was received on frequency 1420MHz and the message was a sounding of Pi. 
The frequency was within a radio range known as the waterhole by Scientists because it is the best range of frequencies for transmitting without interference. 
Because of this most radio receivers searching for extra-terrestrial life are receiving only on that bandwidth. When the Frequency is multiplied by Pi we get a 
frequency that is outside the waterhole range yet still a conceivable transmitting frequency: 3.141592654*1420=4461.06156868MHz. So they could be telling us 
that future transmissions will be on that frequency. <br> <br>

Another science question is: does this transmission orginate from our universe? There is a planet known as Kepler-186f which shows very similar properties to 
earth and resides in the goldilocks zone around its star. But no evidence has been found as to whether it has the resources to sustain life. Meawhile there 
is a thought-to-be quark star (Cygnus X-3) in the constellation which could be emitting the signals. The star increased its radio frequency emissions a 
thousandfold. ANd since then it has been emitting radio outbursts with a regular period of 367 days. Could this be an extra-terrestrial technology never 
before imagined: the use of a quark star to send messages across our universe or from another universe? If so this could open up science to a whole new 
level with many things needing to be rethought out. <br> 2 points <br> <hr>


Norwich School:
We can either assume that the impulses are EM waves or that they are not.  If they are then they will travel at the speed of light 
in a vacuum so will take 6070 years to reach earth from the constellation as Cygnus is 6070 lightyears away from earth.  As there 
is nothing faster than the speed of light, any wave that is not part of the EM spectrum would take longer than 6070 years to reach earth.  
This means that the aliens must have invented the computer (or something similar) more than 6070 years ago and are therefore far more 
technologically advanced than the human race. <br> 1 point <br> <hr>


The Pi-gressives:
What has passed many people's eyes is the very specific timing of 4.1 seconds on/off time. This timing is not only odd because of it being a decimal, 
but also due to a related number having several interesting mathematical properties, namely 41 (a possible explanation for the aliens using a 4.1s 
interval is that a 41s interval would seem like background noise).<br><br>

Now, 41 is the 13th smallest prime number (it is possible to speculate that this is why the total transmission time was 13 days). 
41 is also an Eisenstein prime (it is of the form 3n-1) and a Proth Prime. Not only this, but 41 is the sum of 2 squares, 
namely 4^2 and 5^2. Another unique property is that the function x^2 + x + 41 yields primes for values of -40<n<40. 
These mathematical properties only go to show the ingenuity of the aliens, assuming that their choice of time difference was deliberate.<br><br>

In science, Niobium corresponds to the atomic number of 41. This has applications in steel production, but more importantly in super 
alloys and superconducting magnets. Not only this, but Niobium is used in Superconducting Radio frequency cavities, and as detectors 
due to its high sensitivity. This could possibly mean that the aliens are effectively saying: "Look, we sent you a sign. We have our 
ears open and are waiting." Not to mention Niobium's usage in medicine and electro ceramics, it already seems that 41 is of significance.<br>

MTBS :
The 12 0s in the end of line 2 could mean that the number of decimal places is rounded off to 10 significant figures as the first two 0s just means 
a break and the last ten 0s means it's rounded to 10 s.f. Instead of an ending of transmission. <br> 1 point <br> <hr>

The Fractals:
The manner in which the code was phrased is interesting; for no base was used as a method of counting; the code was not in binary as then it would 
be phrased 7,1,15,1,31,511,3,63,31,15, nor was it in any base. It was shown as a simplistic series of one dot for 1, two dots for 2, etc. This 
could either sugest a different way of development of society: on Earth, we started off using counting systems like the Romans' and Ancient Egyptians' 
where it was I,II,III,IV( or IIII), V and so on. Then we progressed to the more modern systems we use today, capable of handling much greater numbers. 
The aliens could have had a different development where a method of calculation was based on this style but could handle much larger numbers, as the 
older versions were unable to handle large numbers efficiently. Therefore, either the aliens have had a different development of culture or they are 
using this to give a simpler way of conveying information to less advanced civilisations. Also, we must consider the significance of the duration of 
the individual parts of the code. For instance, the minimum duration of 0.4s may have some significance. It may be deemed long enough to interpret 
the code by the aliens or it may be of deeper importance to their society. It may be a precise fraction of their rotational period, ie day, or 
there is a great possibility that it may be something like their resting heart rate, which would be ~150 bpm, which would indicate a smaller 
physiology. Also, in the SI system, lengths are defined as the distance light travels in a vacuum in a fraction of a second. So, following 
from this, 29600km/s*0.4s roughly equals 118000km to two significant figures. This could be information: it is just shy of the planetary radius 
of Saturn, and a reasonable distance for a close satellite, natural or artificial, maybe giving hints at their solar system and planet of origin. 
So, there may be many pieces of information in this morass of a signal, not dissimilar to he rather messy Voyager plate which nevertheless contains 
enough information to locate Earth and contains much about culture and scientific knowledge.<br>

Infinity(1):
It has now been universally acknowledged that the series of pulses interruptng the regular 4.1s on, 4.1s off pattern represent Pi rounded to 10 siginificant figures and 9 decimal points. The question is: 'why stop at 9 decimal points?' The advanced intellect of this extra terrestrial species which is being continually discussed within this communtiy of scientists indicates that the aliens could have included any number of significant figures or decimal points of Pi in their message. There is, of course, the idea that this species seek to demonstrate their knowledge of the mechanisms of earth. 10 is universally recognised as the human counting base and is also a central digit to mathematics as we know it. The fact that the only apparent way these pulses can be made sense of is by translating them to base 10 seems to support this idea.
<p>
</p>
However there may be other reasons for them stopping at 10 significant figures. Inifinity sought to find an alternative interpretation by calculating the total length of time over which the pulse was turned 'on.' Multiplying 0.4- the minimum on or off pulse time- by each base 10 digit in the message (3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5 and 4) and then finding the sum of these numbers gave us the integer: 16.
<p>
</p>
Is this a coincedence or is the number 16 significant, in any way, to discovering what the aliens are trying to communicate?
<p>
</p>
As it happens, 16 holds several roles in mathematics and science which are worth noting. 16 is the square of 4 and, more importantly, the fourth power of 2- perhaps this reinforces the idea that the aliens are trying to show their familiarity with customs on planet earth since the number 2 also has a special place in mathematics. 16 is also the atomic number of the element: sulfur- this may act as an insight into the composition of the atmosphere of their Hot Jupiter home planet from where the signals appear to be coming. Furthermore, 16 is the base of the hexadecimal number system, which is used extensively in computer science- they may be implying their progress in technology which seems to parallel or maybe even exceed that of Earth.

KRS(1):
As 1420MHz is a clear frequency, this suggests that the supposed extra-terrestrial life are highly intelligent and able to minimise any noise in their signal transmission via the use of digital or binary methods rather than analogue. The wavelength also suggests that radio waves were used, which is very easily detected by the Lovell telescope. The mathematics  that they are using also suggests that they are far more advanced than human intelligence due to the time that this signal was originally transmitted.
The use of Pi is interesting as it is to 9 decimal places. Taken with all of the additional information, this could be an attempt at transmitting a location or a type of SOS message. It is important to note, however, that based on the frequency and wavelength this signal was transmitted 6,070 light years ago, and it has only just reached us due to wavelengths (radio waves) and speed of travel in space.
Rather than a glitch code, this could be a break in the transmission to signal the start and stop of the message. The 12 zeros could be representative of the 12 days taken to separate the glitches, so these could be the time it takes for Pi to be completely transmitted.

Nice Dynamite (1): 
The signal originated from the star HD185269 within the constellation of Cygnus. From research done by Moutou and Johnson, we currently know that there is a Hot Jupiter planet orbiting the star. The signal could have originated from within the Hot Jupiter planet. Our own carbon-based structure could not have formed on HD185269b - it simply doesn't contain a high enough concentration of carbon. However, Hot Jupiters are predominately composed of silicon compound gases; from this we can theorise that if life did exist on one, it would be silicon based. Silicon is a viable alternative to carbon in organic molecules as it is in the same group as carbon and can form molecules similar to that of carbon: for example, the gas silane is almost identical to methane in structure, but with a silicon atom instead of a carbon atom. Due to this, it may be possible for more complex organic molecules that could create life forms.
<p>
</p>
Another alternative is that the size of the Hot Jupiter could be preventing smaller planets that are more agreeable to life and similar to ours from being detected, as signals from them may be smaller or weaker. Due to the presence of a Hot Jupiter planet, it could be possible that moons with a more rocky composition are present, which also could be a potential source of intelligent life as currently known theories of life development require a solid surface.
<p>
</p>
The planet itself is also highly unique as it has a eccentric orbit which is very uncommon for Hot Jupiters - it implies that it is not tidally locked, which would decrease the temperature variation across it and decrease the wind speeds making it a slightly more plausible source to harbor life.

J.A.R.V.I.S (1):
The code shows the sequence of pi, 3.141592654 which could be a suggestion of circular motion probably that of an orbit for Albireo A.
<p>
</p>
The circumference of a circle is 2piR and the time for one revolution is the period. The speed of an object is given by 2piR / t. The average speed is the circumference multiplied by the rotational frequency.
<p>
</p>
The acceleration is the speed inversely related to the radius of the circumference of the orbit, the equation being v2 / R.
<p>
</p>
The speed could be given by the number of "0's"  or "off" in the code of which there are 22. If this is multiplied by the duration of the pulse, the speed could be given. The speed could be 4.1*10^22 or 4.1*22 however as there is no knowledge of the unit of speed whether it be light years, miles or kilometres. The time for a collision to be made with earth is 280 light years divide by the speed.
<p>
</p>
This could be a message from extraterrestrial beings warning us of a possible future collision with Earth and which could be the purpose of a signal being sent.

The Pi-gressives (2): 
Reconsidering the calculations, the new translational distances are actually 1.60 x 10^19 m down and 1.48 x 10^19 to the right of Cygnus. This gives, using Pythag, the new distance of the signal to be 2.18 x 10^19m from Cygnus (taking into consideration Alphabeta's point, we can see that the distance is not similar to pi). Despite the value being astray from pi, it is important to note that an alien civilisation capable of sending us such a message, and who ALSO count in base 10 (most likely), would be aware of the consequences of sending such a leading message that encoded pi. What seems more likely is that pi is relevant, but the coding of 12 zeroes is slightly suspicious.
<p>
</p>
Relating this to Lunartics' point, it seems irrelevant to relate 12 to a time period. This is due to the fact that 12 is a highly divisible and countable number (i.e. it is easy to base systems around it). What seems more likely is that the aliens are indicating several dots in front of the given value of pi, as to indicate their knowledge of its transcendentality and irrationality.
<p>
</p>
Going back to the problem at hand:
Taking into account the approximate distance, and we know that Cygnus is 6070 light years away, we speculate that we have the hypotenuse (6070 ly) and opposite side (the calculated value) of a not-so-quite-right-angled triangle. We know the difference in declination is 0.279 rad. Using sine rule, we have 2.18 x 10^19/sin(0.279) =5.742827 x 10^19/ sin(phi), where phi describes the angle Earth-Signal-Cygnus. Hence, Phi is crudely 0.72486... = 0.725 rad. This leaves the remaining angle to be 2.137... = 2.14 rad (which is considerably large), indicating that the signal is behind Cygnus, as Lunartics pointed out. Employing the cosine rule, we see that the distance from Earth is: sqrt((6070ly)^2 + (2.18 x 10^19)^2 - (2 x (6070ly) x (2.18 x 10^19) x cos(2.137...))) = 7.15637... x10^19m = 7.16 x 10^19 m away from earth through the respective equinox declination. Important, and quite controversial, is that 7.16 is just over 2pi, and considering our estimates were an over estimate, this does not seems like a coincidence.

The Turing machines (2):
Taking a different perspective it could be suggested that the code is just a sequence of binary numbers.  If this is the case then the number of bits used for each number must be decided. The repeating signal consists of 10 0s and 10 1s so the number of bits could be 10. If this is the case then the sequence of numbers sent is 915 807 831 921 999 828. However, this is assuming that they are using base 10, so the lack of pattern that we see may not matter. We also looked at 5 bits for each number. This gave us some repeated numbers but there was still no clear pattern. Once again this could be because they are using a different number system.

Tomshanoenyu (1):
The radio signal glitch was detected being sent twice from Cygnus. Also in between the groups of 1's there were pairs of 0's. All the numbers in the rounded version of pi in the transmission can be counted up and rounded to 2:

But more ideas can be derived from this:

<img src="/static/2014/numbercol2.png"  height="150" alt="home"  title="HIP96507" border="0" class="image_section_right" align="middle" target="_blank" />
</br>
The number count adds up to ten. This is repeated twice and in international CB radio codes that is 10-2 which means receiving well. So they could be informing us that they are receiving radio transmissions from earth. Alternatively they could be trying to say 10-10 which means transmission completed, standing by. This could mean that they are waiting for a signal from us. Which would mean they are advanced enough to have worked out codes from our radio signals and understand us well enough to want us to send them a signal. This would show great deduction and intelligence in the extra- terrestrials. This could mean many things. The most significant reasons they could have for knowing how to understand codes and languages would be if they had reason to keep secrets and find out the secrets of others of their species. This might mean that they have had wars and may not be a completely peaceful species. This could raise serious concern among governments and we may be seeing powerful defences being installed around the world soon.

The Pi-gressives (1): 

We are given that the right ascension is 19hrs 37 minutes, and declination is 28 degrees 30 arcmin. Now, Cygnus is located at 20 hrs 35 mins and 28 seconds right ascension, and declination of 44 degrees 32 arcmin and 70arcsec. Converting these to radians (considering that pi is encoded in the message), we get a difference of 0.2581... right ascension and 0.2792... declination (without vectorising). Trying to visualize this, we see that the signal is coming from "slightly to the right" and "slightly down" from the official Cygnus location.
<p>
</p>
This is where we simplify slightly, taking into account our approximations, in order to work out a distance of the origin of the signal from Cygnus. As we are considering distance in a circle sweeping from the Earth to the considerable distance of roughly 6070 light years, we shall take the arc length, r(theta) to be the straight line from Cygnus to the right ascension and declination of the signal. Taking this, we see that the signal is approx. 9.461 x 10^15m x 0.2581... = 2.44 x 10^15m to the right of Cygnus (3 s.f.), and 9.461 x 10^15 x 0.2792... = 2.64 x 10^15m down from Cygnus. (This is treating the Earth as a point mass). Hence, the distance of the signal from Cygnus is approx. 3.60 x 10^15m (note how close this is to pi's figures).

Alphabeta (1):
 What if we are wrong? True the number does resemble pi. But we can't base all of our research on the possibility that they sent us pi. What would happen if it were a universal coincidence?  For all we know what we call pi is something completely different.  We do not know their technological differences. We are reaching for the code to be pi but it might not be. In 1974 we sent out a message the Arecibo message. In it we told space what we are to our atomic level. What if they are doing the same? This code could maybe not be pi but a hidden message.

Norwich School (1):
As the signals that have been received appear to have numerical value, the 'alien' species that we believe to be lurking in outer space seem to have near-human intellect.  The apparent use of pi suggests to us that these aliens may be trying to discover the area or circumference of the planet earth, possibly to invade.  Although this event seems unlikely, NASA have decided to respond to the aliens' signals by sending out the same signals- if the aliens understand that there is human life on earth then they may be deterred from invading.  Any response from them to this may also allow us to find out more about this mysterious species.

Lunartics (2):
Looking at the 12 zeros, this could have significance to the time period after which the message was sent a second time. For us on Earth, this was 12 earth days, however on another planet 12 earth days may be equivalent to 1 rotation on the exoplanet's axis, or one month on this other planet etc. 0.4s may also be a significant time period, hence each individual pulse unit, aka '1' has this length. This is possibly a unit of time for this extraterrestrial species.
<p>
</p>
The Jansky is suitable unit for radio astronomy due to bright  astronomical radio sources having flux densities generally in the range of 1 to 100 janskys.  This particular signal has a flux density of only several janskys suggesting that the source is not particularly bright and is therefore likely to be quite a distance away from the Earth. It has come from around Alberio, which is in Cygnus, which is 430 light years from the earth, with a magnitude of +3.08. If we convert this magnitude from magnitude V units into jansky it gives us 3.15E+02 Jy. This is far higher than the flux density of the signal, hence the exoplanet is likely to be further away from the earth than alberio.

With regard to the base 10, the extraterrestrial life form may or may not have a base 10 number system. If they are more advanced as hypothesised by the scientists in our earlier post, due to the transmission at 1420MHz, they may also have converted their number system to base 10 to aid us (humans) so as to make it easier for us to decipher their communications.

Aciphersoreeyes (1):
The message starts and ends with bytes of information 11111111 and 00000000; the ASCII codes of which are NULL and a non-braking space, which may prevent a break in the signal. The code gives Pi to 9 decimal places. This may mean that the creators of the signal may have access to modern technology - given that most modern calculators give values as accurately as 10 place values on their display.

The Fractals (2):
Assuming the many other teams, here I shall credit Team Mitchell as an example, are correct in their deductions of pi being the transmitted information, then this would indicate that this is an artificial signal, as although there are many possibilities, in likelihood all happening somewhere, I refuse to believe that this is a coincidence. The usage of pi would suggest a civilisation not sending this out by accident, as I would assume that this would not constitute much entertainment. This would indicate a civilisation trying to contact another, to find out if it is alone in the Universe or not. This can be deduced as pi is a relatively simple constant, discovered thousands of years ago on Earth. However, as this is a mathematical constant of importance, it would be a logical signal to send, not dissimilar to the Voyager plate, as it would be assumed that most civilizations would have got this far. However, as in my previous post, where I deduced that in all likelihood the signal originated form the system of the star HD 185269, which is ~153 light years away, this signal must have been sent in the past. As this signal is sent via radio waves, which is a form of electromagnetic radiation, it is sent with photons at the speed of light. Without changing for possible gravitational effects on this, this signal was sent ~ 153 years ago. As Marconi invented the modern radio on Earth 119 years ago, this would suggest that the alien civilisation is more advanced than ours, having invented the radio first. In addition, this signal would suggest that the aliens have found the full potential of the radio, and improved upon its design to make its meaning distinguishable form this distance, which would put the aliens even further ahead of us, and have already fostered a questioning mindset.

LGM response to Aphelion (2): Their specific choice of 1420 MHz is also significant as it is an uncommon frequency in the natural world, this is not true. This frequency is the natural emission frequency of neutral hydrogen the most common element in the universe. So it is far from uncommon!

Looking at the estimated right ascension and declination of the source, 19h 37m and 28 degrees 30 arcmin respectively, it would be likely that a) this source is the location of the supposed aliens and b) that this area be home to a star and planetary system. In Cygnus, there is only one known star which matches this data, called HD 185269. There is known, from the research of two teams, lead by Moutou and Johnson, published in 'Astronomy and Astrophysics' and 'The Astrophysical Journal' respectively, that this is a planetary system. However, this is a Jupiter-like planet, ie a gas giant, with an erratic orbit. However, I believe this is an unlikely source of the transmission, as the local star is more massive than the Sun and has 4 times the absolute magnitude and, not forgetting, the planet orbits at just over a thirteenth of the distance the Earth does. Therefore, this shows evidence of either another planet capable of sustaining life as we know it in the system or it shows that their life is not carbon-based. It is possible, we know for sulphur-based life, but apart form that, what could withstand such immense heat?  Also, it is a possibility that this could be a relay of a signal sent form another area, as there is little evidence to show another planet in the system. This would indicate an advanced civilization.

Globular (1): 
Pi is an irrational number, so the next digit has to be calculated not simply known by looking at a repeating pattern. The decimal places of Pi can therefore go on to infinity. Maybe the extraterrestrial life is trying to indicate to us how far away they are by giving us 10 digits or 9 decimal places of Pi, relative to the infinite number of decimal places. Are they saying they are astronomically very close to us?

<hr> Turing Machines (1): The frequency of the signal allows us to deduce the the wavelength which works out to be 0.211m this is a radio wave signal. 
The Cygnus constellation is 6,070 light years away which also enables us to work out that the signal was sent 6,070 years ago as radio waves travel 
at the speed of light. This suggests that the aliens had an advanced enough understanding of maths and technology to code and transmit this signal 
long before the human race had even a slight understanding of basic mathematics.

<hr> Aphelion (3): The aliens have decided to send pi as this is a significant number to any intelligent civilization (the ratio between the circumference 
and diameter of a circle). This indicates that perhaps they wish to make contact with other intelligent life in order to share technologies, thus they "come in peace". 
Their broadcast is also of interest to physicists as it is the first proof that the laws of mathematics are present throughout the universe, 
which was generally accepted before now but there was no undeniable proof that a circle on earth obeys the same laws as a circle millions of 
light years away would. The two circles could differ for many reasons, including multiple dimensions theories.
Perhaps if communication and shared technologies are possible then the future could be very exciting indeed, broadening our understanding of 
the universe we live in and perhaps finding more living creatures.

Aphelion (2): The signal is transmitted in binary, or digital. This could mean that they have no concept of analogue signals, 
however the more likely possibility is that they fully understand both types of signal and have chosen to use digital because 
it does not become too distorted by noise and can be cleaned up. Also, it is a more definitive broadcast which is easier to 
recognise as an attempt at contact. Their specific choice of 1420 MHz is also significant as it is an uncommon frequency in 
the natural world. It stands out as being of intelligent origin as there are very few other transmitters of this frequency.

Radio waves are low frequency, long wavelength parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. This means that they were 
easily within the hearing range of the Lovell telescope, as it only looks for radio waves. Simple radio receivers 
use an antenna to pick up a radio wave, and then filter the A.C. signal in the antenna to only the relevant frequencies 
and finally scrub the signal of any unwanted background noise (which could be caused in this case by cosmic radiation).

Aphelion (1): We know that "the signal consists of a series of pulsed radio waves which are not of natural origin"
We assume that we can trust the scientists that it truly is of an extra-terrestrial origin, and these radio waves are not being emitted from a pulsar star or stars.<br> <br>

The fact that the aliens decided to use radio waves tells us a lot about them. We know, for example, that they must have the technology to broadcast and receive this range of the electromagnetic spectrum. One could even speculate that they can see this part of the spectrum. Radio waves transmitters are long antennas which give off different frequencies when stimulated by an electric current. However, it is important to note that radio waves are reflected by a layer of charged particles in our atmosphere, and therefore it is surprising that the extra-terrestrials did not use microwaves to transmit their message, as these are unaffected by the atmosphere. Their decision could tell us several things though. They could inhabit a planet with a significantly different atmosphere to us, which would have incredibly interesting biological consequences. Or, their state of scientific advancement could be lesser than our own, and they could have only a limited idea of what each type of wave is best suited to, but this seems unlikely since microwaves have a higher frequency and shorter wavelength than radio waves, and should in theory be easier to detect and measure. The final option that we could deduce from 
their choice of radio waves, could be that they are not concerned about interference from an atmosphere because they are in a shuttle or satellite, or because they 
have expanded from their home planet and currently inhabit a planet without an atmosphere. Both of these options would have significant consequences for mankind, as 
it would mean that contact is possible!

<hr> <br> Team Mitchell (3):
 Let's analyze the significance of the frequency at which the transmission was sent. <br> 
1420MHZ, which is in the Hydrogen line, was also used in the infamous "Wow!" signal (6EQUJ5), during 1977. 
Could this be from the same species of aliens? If so, it must be noted that the "Wow!" signal was traced back to the Sagittarius constellation, 
which could suggest that the aliens have colonized other planets beside their own! Cygnus and Sagittarius, linking back to the remarkable Pi signal, 
are 60 degrees away from eachother, in relation to the center of the Milky way. <br> <br>
 Who is to even say they are, putting it comically, life as we know it? It is equally likely that they are a multitude of the same creature, 
working with one goal, known as a hive mind. This way, if one part dies, the species continues to thrive. This would agree with their seemingly 
high intelligence.
recently, NASA found a planet with similar hospitability to earth, Kepler-186f (<a href="http://rt.com/usa/nasa-kepler-planet-habitabal-zone-256/"> 
http://rt.com/usa/nasa-kepler-planet-habitabal-zone-256/ </a>). 
Could this be the origin of the signal? Kepler-186f is in the hospitable region away from the star it orbits, although it only receives 
a third of the energy that the Earth receives from our Sun.

AppleSource (1):

So far our group have found out that the signal matches Pi to 11 significant figures and and has been sent at the same frequency as hydrogen. 
They have used binary to send a base 10 number to 10 decimal places. This could signify that 10 may be poignant in there culture.<br> <br>

Elaborating further, the 1420 MHz matches the frequency of the Wow! Signal and matches very closely to to the hydrogen line. The hydrogen 
line frequency is significant because it is the most common element in the universe.<br> <br>

Also, we have looked up the location but it isn't anything significant - yet. It may be an open cluster near Albireo.

The signal transmitted which  has been translated into 1's and 0's is pi to to 10 significant figures. 3.141592654. 
After this there are 12 zeros, indicating that they will send the next transmission in 12 day's time. 
The fact that they've done pi to 10 significant figures means that it is likely that they also have number system base 10. 
Since it has a central frequency of 1420 MHz which is the Hydrogen Line. The scholars Philip Morrison at Cornell University 
and Frank Drake at NRAO in 1959 suggested that a civilisation that was more advanced than us, (humans), would transmit at this central frequency.

Flowers (2): The frequency of 1420MHz of the signal is the emission frequency of neutral hydrogen. 
It is a clear window in the spectrum with few natural interferences. Since this is due to our atmosphere, 
they may have a similar atmosphere or have observed our own. We put information about the hydrogen atom in 
Voyager, so they may have intercepted Voyager. They also clearly have knowledge of the emission spectrum.

Surrounding the glitch in the sequence is a repeating series of long signals(1111111111000000000011111111110000000000). 
These radio signals are emitted by the neutron star within Cygnus when it spins and are picked up by the Lovell telescope.

Team Mitchell (2): So, what implications does the aliens knowing Pi have? Examining the actual value they gave, the code only presents 
an estimate of Pi to 10 significant figures. On earth, at around 480 AD, Pi was determined to 6 significant figures, whereas 
in 1424, Pi was determined to 16 significant figures. Could this suggest that the aliens are developed to a similar level of 
humans at this stage in our development? <br> <br>
It is fascinating that out of all numbers, and all messages, from "is anyone there?" to prime numbers, these beings chose Pi. 
Pi is notoriously difficult in computation, which suggests that the aliens have a particularly high mathematical aptitude. 
Afterall, Maths is the only universal language, and is therefore the best method of interplanetary communication!
Pi is vital in so many scientific and mathematical situations. Pi is vital in circle geometry, trajectories, trigonometry, 
and interestingly enough, maybe even planetary orbits? Could this suggest that the aliens have at least a substantial 
knowledge of science?

RSETI (3): In the programme Stargate Pi was used as a test by the Asgard, a highly
advanced people, to see if a civilisation is advanced enough for first
contact. Perhaps whoever sent the message intercepted a broadcast of the
show and wanted to show that they are advanced enough to be contacted.
It seems somewhat naive of them to want first contact, given the danger
of alien life forms. And humans. Especially humans.<br> <br>

However this seems very unlikely. Even if the people who sent the
message were able to intercept TV signals (which is highly doubtful), it
is even more unlikely they were able to understand the premise of an
Earth sci-fi TV programme. Unless they were far more intelligent than
us, which seems to be at odds with their naiveness.<br> <br>

It is possible that the message was sent by human technology, but it
seems strange for something humans built to be broadcasting the digits
of Pi. This could quite easily be stored in memory if a robot or
whatever else needed it.

Flowers (1):  

We've noticed that it's pi to 10 s.f.
The fact that we can recognise it as pi indicates that the aliens also use base ten.
We may therefore conclude that they have 10 of something to count with e.g fingers or TENtacles. Or they could be watching us...

<br>Team Mitchell (1): It looks Like the first and third lines are points which can be used do determine the start and end of each signal, where the signal pulses on for 4 seconds, off, on for 4 seconds, and then off.
Therefore, this would suggest that the second line is the main signal. There is a repeating pattern of "00" throughout the code. Seperating and counting the number of 1's after each signal leaves us with 3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,4. 3.131592654 is a very close estimate of the value of Pi! the code is informing us that the aliens have an understanding of what Pi is.
This suggests that the aliens have a strong understanding of circular mathematics, and therefore may share a human-like intellect in regards to mathematics, if not much greater.

 <br><p> SETI DATA RELEASE <p>

Jodrell Bank, UK: On 2014 July 14 at UTC 02:36 (MJD 2456852.60848) a signal
 was detected by the Lovell telescope. The signal is believed to 
be of extra-terrestrial origin and not naturally produced. We invite the world's scientific 
community to interpret it.<p>

The Lovell telescope has been periodically tracking a repeating signal in the constellation Cygnus for 13 days ? a significant 
and 
reproducible glitch in the periodic pattern has now been observed on two occasions. The signal was detected as a narrow-bandwidth, 
irregularly repeated 
pulse, at a central frequency of 1420MHz. It appears to originate within Cygnus, 
located at approximately Right 
Ascension 19 hours 37 min and Declination +28 degrees 30 arcmin. The 
signal has a flux density of several Jansky. For the majority 
of the time the signal consists of 4.1s 
when the signal is on followed by 4.1s off, repeating continuously. Two observations of a short 
change 
in this pattern have been observed and the glitch pattern has been confirmed to match on the two occasions. 
The two glitch 
observations were separated by approximately 12 days. The minimum on or off pulse time is 
0.4s long ? we represent periods when the 
pulse is turned off as zero and times when it is turned on are 
set to 1. The signal is: <p>
