The SETI Challenge (6th-10th July 2015) is a competition for UK school pupils aged 14-18. 
</p>

The storyline is that astronomers have discovered radio signal communications from aliens. Unable to translate 
the meaning of the signal they have asked for the world science community to help them decipher and interpret the data. 
The pupil teams will play the role of scientific groups tackling the problem.	<p>
</p>
Teams can consist of groups from 1 individual up to a "class"  each team must have the sponsorship of a teacher from their school. ><p>
</p>
A new signal from the aliens will be released each morning of the week long challenge at 10am. 
<p>
</p>
Teams can then participate in two challenges:
	<p>
</p>
 <div class="title">Science Challenge: </div> A team can submit up to 3 entries to the science forum each day to score points 
these entries should contribute to decoding the message, deducing what it tells us about the aliens, or any other relevant science. 	
<p>
</p>
<div class="title">Media Reports: </div> A team can also submit up to 3 entries each day to the news feed
These should be fictional stories about the impact of the alien signals on people around planet Earth. Light hearted as well as hard hitting exclusives will receive marks. 
<p>
</p>

in the Science Forum will receive &#163;300, the second team &#163;150, and the third team &#163;75.

The top scoring team in each of the UK and SA in the Media Forum will receive &#163;150, the second team &#163;75, and the third team &#163;50. We also have 8 &#163;25 prizes for significant other contributions.

Have a go !!!

 To set the scene here is a sample signal for you to have a go at
it consists of a modulated radio wave labelled as 1 for a period of high amplitude and 0 for low amplitude 
(we will give you more detail of the signal in the real challenge but for the moment what message is lurking in here?). 
The signal has long periods of 10,10,10 but then changes for a period to<p>
