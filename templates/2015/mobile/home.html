Strange news today, Monday 6th July 2015, from the Large Hadron Collider experiment at CERN, Geneva. Scientists 
are reporting very high-energy collision events in the LHC detectors when the particle beams are switched off! 
The Director General of CERN has described everyone as ‘excited but baffled’. Later today CERN has promised to 
release their first data set to the world community and are inviting scientists world wide to work on the meaning of the mystery.
</p>

<p>
No translation of the signal has yet been made and as a result of this the 
particle physicists will release their data in stages to registered members 
of the public at 10am daily from 6th-10th July 2015.
